# Lesson Summary: Enumerations in C#

## Overview
This lesson covers the concept of Enumerations in C#. Enumerations (enums) are used to define a set of named constants that can be assigned to a variable, making the code more readable and less error-prone.

## Key Concepts

### Enumeration
- An enumeration is a distinct type that consists of a set of named constants called the enumerator list.
- Enums are used when a variable can only take one out of a small set of possible values.
- By default, the underlying type of the enumerator is `int`, and the first enumerator has the value `0`, the next `1`, and so on. You can explicitly specify the value of enumerators.

### Benefits
- Restricts a variable to have one of only a few predefined values.
- Improves code readability and maintainability.
- Prevents the assignment of invalid values to the variable.

## Code Examples

### Person.cs
```csharp
public class Person
{
    public string PersonName { get; set; }
    public string Email { get; set; }
    public AgeGroupEnumeration AgeGroup { get; set; }
}

public enum AgeGroupEnumeration : short
{
    Child,
    Teenager,
    Adult = 100,
    Senior
}
```

### Program.cs
```csharp
using System;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        //create object of Person class
        Person person = new Person();
        person.PersonName = "John";
        person.Email = "john@gmail.com";
        person.AgeGroup = AgeGroupEnumeration.Adult;

        Console.WriteLine(person.AgeGroup);
        Console.ReadKey();
    }
}
```

## Conclusion
Enumerations in C# are a useful way to define a set of named constants that can be assigned to a variable. They improve code readability and maintainability by restricting variables to predefined values, thereby preventing the assignment of invalid values. Enums can also have an underlying type other than `int`, such as `short`, as demonstrated in the example.
