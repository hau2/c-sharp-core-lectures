# Action in C#

## Overview
In this lesson, we will learn about `Action`, a predefined delegate in C#. `Action` is similar to `Func`, but it is always `void`, meaning it does not return a value. It is useful when you need to perform actions without returning any result.

## Key Concepts

### Action
- `Action` is a predefined generic delegate type in C#.
- It can have 0 to 16 parameters but always returns `void`.
- Useful for quickly creating delegates and events without defining custom delegate types.

### Characteristics
- No return type (always `void`).
- All type parameters are parameter types.
- Cannot use `ref` or `out` parameters.
- Commonly used for creating events and delegates in real-time applications.

## Example

### Publisher Class with Action Event
```csharp
using System;

namespace ClassLibrary1
{
    // Publisher
    public class Publisher
    {
        // Step 1: Create event using Action
        public event Action<int, int> myEvent;

        public void RaiseEvent(int a, int b)
        {
            // Step 2: Raise event
            if (this.myEvent != null)
            {
                this.myEvent(a, b);
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Program.cs with Action Event Handling
```csharp
using System;
using ClassLibrary1;

namespace EventsExample
{
    // Subscriber class
    class Program
    {
        static void Main()
        {
            // Create object of Publisher class
            Publisher publisher = new Publisher();

            // Handle the event (or) subscribe to event using Action
            publisher.myEvent += (a, b) => {
                int c = a + b;
                Console.WriteLine(c);
            };

            // Invoke the event
            publisher.RaiseEvent(10, 20);
            publisher.RaiseEvent(5, 80);
            publisher.RaiseEvent(14, 22);

            Console.ReadKey();
        }
    }
}
```

## Summary
- **Action** provides a convenient way to use predefined delegates in C#, useful for methods that do not return a value but have up to 16 parameters.
- The **Publisher** class raises the event, and the **Action delegate** handles the event without needing a separate subscriber class.
- `Action` simplifies code and is particularly useful for handling events and creating quick, inline methods.

`Action` is an efficient way to create delegates and events on-the-fly and handle events in a concise manner.
