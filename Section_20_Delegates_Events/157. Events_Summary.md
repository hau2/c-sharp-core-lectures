# Events in C#

## Overview
In this lesson, we will learn about events in C#. An event is a special kind of multicast delegate that is created and invoked in a Publisher class and subscribed to in a Subscriber class. Events follow the Publisher-Subscriber pattern, where the Publisher class provides notifications to the Subscriber class.

## Key Concepts

### Events
- Events are basically delegates and can contain references to one or more methods.
- Events implement the Publisher-Subscriber architecture.
- Events can only be raised in the same class in which they are created.

## Important Points
- **Publisher Class:** The class that creates and raises the event.
- **Subscriber Class:** The class that subscribes to the event and defines the event handler method.
- **Delegate Type:** A prerequisite for working with events. The event is created based on a delegate type that defines the parameters and return type of the methods it can reference.

## Example

### Publisher Class with Event
```csharp
using System;

namespace ClassLibrary1
{
    // Delegate type
    public delegate void MyDelegateType(int a, int b);

    // Publisher
    public class Publisher
    {
        // Private delegate
        private MyDelegateType myDelegate;

        // Step 1: Create event
        public event MyDelegateType myEvent
        {
            add
            {
                myDelegate += value;
            }
            remove
            {
                myDelegate -= value;
            }
        }

        public void RaiseEvent(int a, int b)
        {
            // Step 2: Raise event
            if (this.myDelegate != null)
            {
                this.myDelegate(a, b);
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Subscriber Class with Event Handler
```csharp
using System;
using ClassLibrary1;

namespace EventsExample
{
    public class Subscriber
    {
        // Target method
        public void Add(int a, int b)
        {
            Console.WriteLine(a + b);
        }
    }
}
```

### Program.cs
```csharp
using System;
using ClassLibrary1;

namespace EventsExample
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main()
        {
            // Create object of Subscriber class
            Subscriber subscriber = new Subscriber();

            // Create object of Publisher class
            Publisher publisher = new Publisher();

            // Handle the event (or) subscribe to event
            publisher.myEvent += subscriber.Add;

            // Invoke the event
            publisher.RaiseEvent(10, 20);

            Console.ReadKey();
        }
    }
}
```

## Summary
- **Events** are a way to provide notifications between classes in a loosely coupled manner.
- The **Publisher** class raises the event, and the **Subscriber** class handles the event through an event handler method.
- Events are created based on **delegate types** and follow the Publisher-Subscriber pattern.

By using events, you can create applications that respond to changes in data or user actions in a clean and maintainable way.
