# Lesson Summary: Expression Bodied Members in C#

## Introduction
Expression Bodied Members is a feature introduced in C# 7.0. It allows methods, properties, constructors, destructors, and indexers to be defined using a simplified syntax, provided they have a single statement, value, or expression.

## Key Concepts
- **Single Statement or Value**: Expression Bodied Members are used when the member consists of a single statement or value. The method body is not needed separately.
- **Arrow Operator (=>)**: The arrow operator is used to define the expression or statement directly.

## Examples and Usage
1. **Method Example**:
    ```csharp
    public int GetStudentNameLength() => _studentName.Length;
    ```
    This method returns the length of the `_studentName` string.

2. **Constructor Example**:
    ```csharp
    public Student() => _studentName = "Harsha";
    ```
    This constructor initializes the `_studentName` field with "Harsha".

3. **Property Example**:
    ```csharp
    public string StudentName
    {
        set => _studentName = value;
        get => _studentName;
    }
    ```
    This property uses the arrow operator for both `set` and `get` accessors.

## Code Example
Here is a complete example of a class using Expression Bodied Members:

```csharp
using System;

namespace ClassLibrary1
{
    public class Student
    {
        // Private field
        private string _studentName;

        // Public method
        public int GetStudentNameLength() => _studentName.Length;

        // Public constructor
        public Student() => _studentName = "Harsha";

        // Public properties
        public string StudentName
        {
            set => _studentName = value;
            get => _studentName;
        }
    }
}
```
## Benefits
- **Simplicity**: The syntax is more concise and easier to read for single-statement members.
- **Convenience**: Useful for simple properties, methods, and constructors.

## Limitations
- **Single Statement**: Can only be used if the member has a single statement or expression.
- **Complex Logic**: Not suitable for members requiring multiple statements or complex logic.

## Conclusion
Expression Bodied Members provide a shorthand way to define simple members in C#, making the code more readable and concise. This feature is particularly useful for single-statement methods, properties, and constructors.
