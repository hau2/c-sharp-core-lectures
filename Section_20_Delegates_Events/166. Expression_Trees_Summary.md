# Expression Trees in C#

## Overview
In this lesson, we will learn about Expression Trees, a feature introduced in C# 3.0. Expression Trees represent code in a tree-like data structure, where each node is an expression. They are primarily used by LINQ providers for translating queries to other formats (like SQL).

## Key Concepts

### Expression Trees
- Expression Trees are collections of delegates arranged in a tree structure.
- They represent code in a tree-like format.
- Expression Trees must be compiled before execution using the `Compile` method.
- They are executed using the `Invoke` method.

### Characteristics
- Expression Trees can store delegates of various types, including `Func`, `Action`, `Predicate`, and custom delegate types.
- Commonly used indirectly by LINQ providers.
- Useful for creating dynamic queries and manipulating code as data.

## Example

### Student Class
```csharp
using System;

namespace ExpressionTreesExample
{
    class Student
    {
        public int StudentID { get; set; }
        public string StudentName { get; set; }
        public int Age { get; set; }
    }
}
```

### Program.cs with Expression Tree
```csharp
using System;
using System.Linq.Expressions;

namespace ExpressionTreesExample
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main()
        {
            // Create object of Student class
            Student s = new Student() { StudentID = 101, StudentName = "Scott", Age = 15 };

            // Create expression tree with Func
            Expression<Func<Student, bool>> expression = st => st.Age > 12 && st.Age < 20;

            // Compile expression using Compile method to invoke it as Delegate
            Func<Student, bool> myDelegate = expression.Compile();

            // Execute the method
            bool result = myDelegate.Invoke(s);

            Console.WriteLine(result);
            Console.ReadKey();
        }
    }
}
```

### Output
```
True
```

## Summary
- **Expression Trees** provide a powerful way to represent and manipulate code in a tree-like format, useful for dynamic query generation and code manipulation.
- The **Student** class represents a student entity, and the **Expression Tree** is used to check if the student's age falls within a specific range.
- Expression Trees are compiled and executed using the `Compile` and `Invoke` methods, respectively.

Expression Trees are a fundamental concept for advanced C# programming, especially when working with LINQ and dynamic query generation.
