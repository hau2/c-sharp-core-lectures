# Anonymous Methods in C#

## Overview
In this lesson, we will learn about Anonymous Methods, a feature introduced in C# 2.0. Anonymous methods allow you to create methods without names, which can be invoked using a delegate or an event.

## Key Concepts

### Anonymous Methods
- Anonymous methods are nameless methods that can be stored in a delegate or an event.
- They are useful for quickly creating methods with less code.
- Anonymous methods can have parameters, return types, local variables, and local functions, much like regular methods.

### Characteristics
- Cannot apply access modifiers (e.g., private, public) or other modifiers (e.g., static, virtual) to anonymous methods.
- The return type is inferred from the delegate type or event.
- Defined using the `delegate` keyword.
- Can be used to subscribe to events without defining a separate subscriber class.

## Example

### Publisher Class with Event
```csharp
using System;

namespace ClassLibrary1
{
    // Delegate type
    public delegate void MyDelegateType(int a, int b);

    // Publisher
    public class Publisher
    {
        // Step 1: Create event
        public event MyDelegateType myEvent;

        public void RaiseEvent(int a, int b)
        {
            // Step 2: Raise event
            if (this.myEvent != null)
            {
                this.myEvent(a, b);
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Program.cs with Anonymous Method
```csharp
using System;
using ClassLibrary1;

namespace EventsExample
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main()
        {
            // Create object of Publisher class
            Publisher publisher = new Publisher();

            // Handle the event (or) subscribe to event using anonymous method
            publisher.myEvent += delegate(int a, int b) {
                int c = a + b;
                Console.WriteLine(c);
            };

            // Invoke the event
            publisher.RaiseEvent(10, 20);
            publisher.RaiseEvent(5, 80);
            publisher.RaiseEvent(14, 22);

            Console.ReadKey();
        }
    }
}
```

## Summary
- **Anonymous Methods** provide a way to create methods without names, useful for event handling and quick method creation.
- The **Publisher** class raises the event, and the **anonymous method** handles the event without needing a separate subscriber class.
- Anonymous methods simplify code and are particularly useful for handling events and creating quick, inline methods.

Anonymous Methods are an efficient way to create methods on-the-fly and handle events in a concise manner.
