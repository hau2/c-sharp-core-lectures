# Lesson Summary: Switch Expressions in C#

## Introduction
Switch Expressions is a feature introduced in C# 8.0. It provides a concise syntax for switch cases, making the code more readable and easier to maintain.

## Key Concepts
- **Single Value Assignment**: Switch Expressions allow assigning a single value based on a switch case.
- **Default Case**: The default case in switch expressions is specified using the underscore (_).

## Examples and Usage
1. **Switch Expression Example**:
    ```csharp
    int operation = 10; //1 to 4
    string result;

    //switch expression
    result = operation switch
    {
        1 => "Customer",
        2 => "Employee",
        3 => "Supplier",
        4 => "Distributor",
        _ => "No case available",
    };

    Console.WriteLine(result);
    Console.ReadKey();
    ```
    This example demonstrates assigning a string value to `result` based on the value of `operation`.

## Code Example
Here is a complete example of using Switch Expressions:

```csharp
using System;

namespace SwitchExpressionExample
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main()
        {
            int operation = 10; //1 to 4
            string result;

            //switch expression
            result = operation switch
            {
                1 => "Customer",
                2 => "Employee",
                3 => "Supplier",
                4 => "Distributor",
                _ => "No case available",
            };

            Console.WriteLine(result);
            Console.ReadKey();
        }
    }
}
```

## Benefits
- **Conciseness**: The syntax is more concise compared to the traditional switch case statements.
- **Readability**: Easier to read and maintain, especially for simple value assignments.

## Limitations
- **Method Calls**: Switch expressions are not suitable for cases where you need to call methods or execute multiple statements.
- **Complex Logic**: Not suitable for complex logic requiring multiple lines of code.

## Conclusion
Switch Expressions provide a shorthand way to define switch cases in C#, making the code more readable and concise. This feature is particularly useful for simple value assignments based on switch cases.
