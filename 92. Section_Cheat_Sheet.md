### Properties
Receive the incoming value; validate the value; assign value into field.

Property is a collection of two accessors (get-accessor and set-accessor).

#### Syntax of Property
```
set
{
  field = value;
}
```
```
get
{
  return field;
}
```

#### Set Accessor
- Used to validate the incoming value and assign the same into field.
- Executes automatically when some value is assigned into the property.
- Has a default (implicit) parameter called "value" which represents the current value assigned to the property.
- Can't have any additional parameters.
- Can't return any value.

#### Get Accessor
- Used to calculate value and return the same or return the value of the field as-is.
- Executes automatically when the property is retrieved.
- Has no implicit parameters.
- Can't have parameters.
- Should return the value of the field.

### Features and Advantages of Properties
- Properties create a protection layer around fields, preventing assignment of invalid values into properties and doing some calculations automatically when the property is invoked.
- No memory will be allocated for the property.

#### Access Modifier of Accessors
- Access modifier is applicable for the property set accessor and get accessor individually.
- Access modifiers of accessors must be more restrictive than the access modifier of the property.

Example:
```
internal  modifier  data_type  PropertyName
{
     private  set { property = value; }
     protected  get { return property; }
}
```

### Read-Only vs Write-Only Properties
#### Read-only Property
```
accessModifier type PropertyName
{
  get
  {
    return field;
  }
}
```
- Contains ONLY 'get' accessor.
- Reads and returns the value of the field but does not modify the value of the field.

#### Write-only Property
```
accessModifier type PropertyName
{
  set
  {
    field = value;
  }
}
```
- Contains ONLY 'set' accessor.
- Validates and assigns incoming value into the field but does not return the value.

### Auto-Implemented Properties
- Property with no definition for set-accessor and get-accessor.
- Used to create property easily (with shorter syntax).
- Creates a private field (with name as _propertyName) automatically at compilation-time.
- Auto-Implemented property can be Read-only (only 'get' accessor) property, but it can't be Write-only (only 'set' accessor).

Example:
```
accessModifier  modifier  data_type  PropertyName
{
     accessModifier  set;
     accessModifier  get;
}
```
- Useful only when you don't want to write any validation or calculation logic.

### Auto-Implemented Property Initializer
- New feature in C# 6.0.
- You can initialize value into auto-implemented property.

### Properties: Key Points to Remember
- It is recommended to use Properties always in real-time projects.
- You can also use 'Auto-implemented properties' to simplify the code.
- Properties don't occupy any memory (will not be stored).
- Properties form a protection layer surrounding the private field that validates the incoming value before assigning it to the field.
- Read-only property has only 'get' accessor; Write-only property has only 'set' accessor.
- Properties can't have additional parameters.

### Indexers
- Receive a number/string. Search for the particular item among a group of items; set or get value into the group of items.
- It provides shorter syntax to access a group of items.

Indexer is a special member of a class which contains set-accessor and get-accessor to access a group of items/elements.

Example:
```
public string this[int index]
{
    get { return _items[index]; }
    set { _items[index] = value; }
}
```

### Indexers: Key Points to Remember
- Indexers are always created with 'this' keyword.
- Indexers are generally used to access a group of elements (items).
- Parameterized properties are called indexers.
- Indexers are implemented through get and set accessors along with the [ ] operator.
- Indexer must have one or more parameters.
- ref and out parameter modifiers are not permitted in indexers.
- Indexer can't be static.
- Indexer is identified by its signature (syntax of calling), whereas a property is identified by its name.
- Indexer can be overloaded.
