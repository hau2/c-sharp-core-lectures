# Inner Classes in C#

## Definition

In C#, an inner class is a class defined within another class.

## Key Features

- **Accessibility**: By default, the inner class is accessible only within the same outer class. However, it can be made accessible outside the outer class by adding the 'public' keyword.
- **Grouping**: The main purpose of an inner class is to group related classes for a specific purpose.

## Example: Banking Project

In a banking project, you can write a set of classes related to interest calculation inside another outer class.

## Practical Example

### Outer Class and Inner Class

Let's create a console application project. We'll add a class library to the solution and reference it in the console application.

```csharp
using System;

namespace ClassLibrary1
{
    public class Student
    {
        public double SecuredMarks;
        public double MaxMarks;
        public double Percentage;
    }

    // Outer class
    public class MarksCalculation
    {
        public void CalculatePercentage(Student s)
        {
            // Create object of inner class
            CalculationHelper ch = new CalculationHelper();
            s.Percentage = ch.Multiply(s.SecuredMarks / s.MaxMarks, 100);
        }

        // Inner class
        public class CalculationHelper
        {
            public double Multiply(double n1, double n2)
            {
                return n1 * n2;
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Usage in Main Method

In the main method of our console application, we demonstrate how to create and use objects of the inner and outer classes.

```csharp
using ClassLibrary1;
using System;

namespace InnerClassesExample
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main()
        {
            // Create an object of inner class
            ClassLibrary1.MarksCalculation.CalculationHelper ch = new ClassLibrary1.MarksCalculation.CalculationHelper();

            // Call the inner class's method
            Console.WriteLine(ch.Multiply(10, 5)); // Output: 50

            // Call outer class's method
            ClassLibrary1.MarksCalculation mc = new ClassLibrary1.MarksCalculation();
            Student s = new Student() { SecuredMarks = 35, MaxMarks = 50 };

            mc.CalculatePercentage(s);
            Console.WriteLine(s.Percentage); // Output: 70

            Console.ReadKey();
        }
    }
}
```

## Important Points to Remember

- The inner class is by default private.
- If you want your inner class to be accessible outside the outer class, you can make it 'public' or 'protected internal'.
- The outer class cannot access the members of the inner class without creating an object of the inner class, and vice versa.
- Creating objects of each other (inner and outer classes) simultaneously can lead to a StackOverflowException.

These points summarize the main aspects of using inner classes in C#.
