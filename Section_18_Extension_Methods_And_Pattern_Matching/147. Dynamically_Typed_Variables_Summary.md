# Dynamically Typed Variables in C#

## Overview
Dynamically typed variables in C# are created using the `dynamic` keyword. Unlike the `var` keyword, dynamically typed variables do not need to have their value initialized upon declaration, and their data type can change throughout the program.

## Differences between `var` and `dynamic`
- **`var` keyword:**
  - Requires initialization at the time of declaration.
  - The data type is fixed by the C# compiler at compile time.

- **`dynamic` keyword:**
  - Does not require initialization at the time of declaration.
  - The data type can change at runtime.
  - No compile-time type checking; errors are caught at runtime.

## Use Cases
Use the `dynamic` keyword when you are unsure of the type of data that will be stored in a variable. This could include numbers, strings, objects, arrays, or collections. 

## Important Features
1. **Type Flexibility:**
   - A dynamically typed variable can change its data type during the program execution.
   
2. **No Compile-Time Type Checking:**
   - The C# compiler does not check whether the methods or properties called on a dynamic variable exist, leading to potential runtime errors if they do not.

3. **No IntelliSense Support:**
   - Visual Studio does not provide IntelliSense for dynamically typed variables, requiring developers to manually check for method or property existence.

## Example Code
Here is a practical example demonstrating the use of dynamically typed variables in a C# program:

```csharp
using System;

namespace DynamicallyTypedVariablesExample
{
    class Student
    {
        public string StudentName { get; set; }
    }
    class Program
    {
        static void Main()
        {
            // dynamically typed variable
            dynamic x;

            x = 100;

            x = "Hello";

            x = new Student() { StudentName = "Harsha" };

            Console.WriteLine(x.StudentName);
            Console.ReadKey();
        }
    }
}
```

In this example:
- A variable `x` is declared as dynamic.
- The variable `x` is assigned an integer, then a string, and finally an object of the `Student` class.
- The `StudentName` property of the `Student` object is accessed and printed.

## Conclusion
Dynamically typed variables provide flexibility in scenarios where the data type may vary, but they also introduce the risk of runtime errors and lack of IntelliSense support. Proper care must be taken to ensure that the necessary methods and properties exist at runtime to avoid errors.
