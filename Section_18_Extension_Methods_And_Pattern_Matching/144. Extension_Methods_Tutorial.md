# Extension Methods in C#

## Introduction
Extension Methods is a method that is written outside the class but logically injected into the class. This means that instead of writing the method inside the same class definition, you write the method in another class and logically inject it into the existing class. 

## Benefits
- Without modifying the actual source code of a class, you can add or inject a new method into the same class.
- Extension Methods can be added to predefined classes that are part of the .Net Framework or to other classes defined by other developers and provided as class libraries.

## Use Cases
1. **Adding Methods to Predefined Classes**: For example, adding a `ToTitleCase` method to the `System.String` class.
2. **Adding Methods to Class Libraries**: For example, receiving a DLL from another developer and adding new methods to the existing classes in that DLL without modifying the source code.

## Implementation
To implement extension methods, you need to create a static class and add a static method inside it. The first parameter of the static method must be prefixed with the `this` keyword to specify the class or interface to which you want to add the extension method.

```csharp
public static class ProductExtensions
{
    public static double GetDiscount(this Product product)
    {
        return product.ProductCost * product.DiscountPercentage / 100;
    }
}
```

In the above example, the `GetDiscount` method is added to the `Product` class as an extension method.

## Example
Let's consider the following scenario:

### Product Class (Original Class)
```csharp
using System;

namespace ClassLibrary1
{
    public class Product
    {
        public double ProductCost { get; set; }
        public double DiscountPercentage { get; set; }
    }
}
```

### Extension Method
```csharp
public static class ProductExtensions
{
    public static double GetDiscount(this Product product)
    {
        return product.ProductCost * product.DiscountPercentage / 100;
    }
}
```

### Using the Extension Method
```csharp
using System;
using ClassLibrary1;

namespace ExtensionMethodsExample
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            Product p = new Product { ProductCost = 1000, DiscountPercentage = 10 };
            double discount = p.GetDiscount();
            Console.WriteLine($"Discount: {discount}");
        }
    }
}
```

## Rules and Limitations
- You must create a static class and a static method with the first parameter prefixed with the `this` keyword.
- Extension Methods cannot override existing methods.
- You can add extension methods to sealed classes.
- Extension Methods are only applicable to methods, not to fields, properties, or events.
- The static class in which you create the extension method cannot be an inner class.

## Conclusion
Extension Methods provide a way to add methods to existing types without modifying the source code of the type. This is especially useful when working with class libraries and predefined classes in the .Net Framework.

## Complete Source Code
### Product.cs
```csharp
using System;

namespace ClassLibrary1
{
    public class Product
    {
        public double ProductCost { get; set; }
        public double DiscountPercentage { get; set; }
    }
}
```

### ProductExtensions.cs
```csharp
public static class ProductExtensions
{
    public static double GetDiscount(this Product product)
    {
        return product.ProductCost * product.DiscountPercentage / 100;
    }
}
```

### Program.cs
```csharp
using System;
using ClassLibrary1;

namespace ExtensionMethodsExample
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            Product p = new Product { ProductCost = 1000, DiscountPercentage = 10 };
            double discount = p.GetDiscount();
            Console.WriteLine($"Discount: {discount}");
        }
    }
}
```
