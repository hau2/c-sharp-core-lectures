# Types of Inheritance

## Single Inheritance
Single inheritance involves one parent class and one child class. 
- **Example**: `Person` is a parent class; `Teacher` is a child class of `Person`.

### Example Code

```csharp
public class Person
{
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public int Age { get; set; }
}

public class Teacher : Person
{
    public string Subject { get; set; }
}
```

## Multi-level Inheritance
Multi-level inheritance occurs when a class is derived from another derived class.
- **Example**: `Person` -> `Teacher` -> `Professor`.

### Example Code

```csharp
public class Person
{
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public int Age { get; set; }
}

public class Teacher : Person
{
    public string Subject { get; set; }
}

public class Professor : Teacher
{
    public string Department { get; set; }
}
```

## Hierarchical Inheritance
Hierarchical inheritance is when multiple child classes inherit from a single parent class.
- **Example**: `Person` -> `Teacher`, `Physician`.

### Example Code

```csharp
public class Person
{
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public int Age { get; set; }
}

public class Teacher : Person
{
    public string Subject { get; set; }
}

public class Physician : Person
{
    public string Specialty { get; set; }
}
```

## Multiple Inheritance (using interfaces)
Multiple inheritance is when a child class has more than one parent class. In C#, this is achieved using interfaces.
- **Example**: `Teacher`, `Physician` -> `MedicalTeacher`.

### Example Code

```csharp
public interface ITeacher
{
    string Subject { get; set; }
}

public interface IPhysician
{
    string Specialty { get; set; }
}

public class MedicalTeacher : ITeacher, IPhysician
{
    public string Subject { get; set; }
    public string Specialty { get; set; }
}
```

## Hybrid Inheritance
Hybrid inheritance is a combination of two or more types of inheritance.
- **Example**: Combination of hierarchical and multi-level inheritance.

### Example Code

```csharp
public class Person
{
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public int Age { get; set; }
}

public class Teacher : Person
{
    public string Subject { get; set; }
}

public class Physician : Person
{
    public string Specialty { get; set; }
}

public class Professor : Teacher
{
    public string Department { get; set; }
}

public class MedicalProfessor : Professor, IPhysician
{
    public string Specialty { get; set; }
}
```

## Conclusion
Understanding the different types of inheritance helps in creating a well-structured and maintainable codebase by promoting code reusability and establishing clear relationships between classes.
