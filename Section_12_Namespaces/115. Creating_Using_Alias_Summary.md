# Lesson Summary: Creating Using Alias in C#

## Overview
This lesson covers the concept of creating alias names for namespaces in C# using the `using alias` directive. By creating alias names, you can assign a shorter, more convenient name to a lengthy namespace path, making your code easier to read and write.

## Key Concepts

### Using Alias Directive
- The `using alias` directive allows you to assign a user-defined name to a namespace.
- Syntax: `using <alias> = <NamespaceName>;`

### Example
- Suppose you have a lengthy namespace path `ERP.Finance.BankAccount.Account`.
- You can create an alias for this path, for example, `using BA = ERP.Finance.BankAccount.Account;`.
- Now, within the same file, wherever you write `BA`, it refers to the full namespace path.

### Benefits
- Simplifies the usage of lengthy namespace paths.
- Resolves name ambiguity when two different namespaces contain classes with the same name.

### Scope of Using Alias
- Alias names are only valid within the file where they are declared.
- They cannot be accessed from other files.

## Code Examples

### Program.cs
```csharp
using HR;
using m = HR.Mgr;
using FrontOffice;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        //Creating objects of Manager class
        m.IManager manager1;
        manager1 = new m.Manager();

        m.IManager manager2;
        manager2 = new m.Manager();

        m.IManager manager3;
        manager3 = new m.Manager();

        //Creating objects of CustomerEnquiry class
        CustomerEnquiry customerEnquiry = new CustomerEnquiry();

        System.Console.ReadKey();
    }
}
```

### HR.cs
```csharp
namespace HR
{
    namespace Mgr
    {
        //interface that represents a manager, which inherits from IEmployee
        public interface IManager : IEmployee
        {
        }

        //class that represents a manager, which inherits from IManager
        public class Manager : IManager
        {
        }

        //class that represents an assistant manager, which inherits from IManager
        public class AsstManager : IManager
        {
        }
    }

    //interface that represents an employee in the organization
    public interface IEmployee
    {
    }

    //interface that represents an executive, which inherits from IEmployee
    public interface IExecutive : IEmployee
    {
    }

    //class that represents an executive, which inherits from IExecutive
    public class Executive : IExecutive
    {
    }
}
```

## Conclusion
The `using alias` directive in C# is a powerful feature that simplifies code by allowing the creation of shorter, more readable names for lengthy namespace paths. This not only reduces redundancy but also helps in resolving name conflicts when different namespaces contain classes with the same name. Understanding and using the `using alias` directive effectively can make your C# programs cleaner and more maintainable.
