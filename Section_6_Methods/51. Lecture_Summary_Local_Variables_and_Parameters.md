# Lecture Summary: Local Variables & Parameters

## Overview
This lecture provides clarity on local variables and parameters. Every method, whether it is an instance method or a static method, can have local variables and parameters.

## Local Variables
Local variables are initialized and used inside the same method body where they are created. They are short-lived and exist only until the end of the method execution. Local variables are stored in the stack of the method.

### Example:
```csharp
public void CalculateTax() {
    double t = 0.1; // Local variable
    // method logic
}
```

## Parameters
Parameters are variables declared inside the method brackets and receive values from the calling method. They are also short-lived and stored in the stack of the method.

### Example:
```csharp
public void SetProductID(int value) { // 'value' is a parameter
    // method logic
}
```

### Types of Parameters
Parameters can be of any type:
- Primitive types: int, float, double, decimal, etc.
- Non-primitive types: struct, class, interface, etc.

## Detailed Explanation
Both local variables and parameters are stored in the stack, and each method call creates a new stack frame. Once the method execution is complete, the stack frame is deleted, and the local variables and parameters are lost.

## Code Examples
Below are some detailed code examples extracted from the provided project files.

### Example from `ClassLibrary1`
```csharp
// Example method from ClassLibrary1
public void ExampleMethod(int param) {
    int localVar = 10;
    // Method logic
}
```
