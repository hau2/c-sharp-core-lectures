# Named Arguments in C#

## Introduction
Named arguments is one of the newly introduced features of C# 4.0. While calling the method, whenever you supply the value based on the parameter name, it is called a named argument.

## Why Use Named Arguments?
In real-time projects, sometimes you may have methods with many parameters and different types of parameters. By default, argument values are assigned to parameters based on the sequence. However, this can be confusing for the caller to understand which argument value goes to which parameter.

### Benefits:
- Improves code readability
- Useful for methods with a large number of parameters
- Ensures that the correct value is passed to the correct parameter

## Example
Consider a method `CalculateTax` with a parameter `percentage`.

```csharp
public void CalculateTax(double percentage)
{
    // Method logic here
}
```

While calling this method:

```csharp
CalculateTax(9.2);
```

It is not clear to which parameter the value `9.2` is being passed. To improve readability, use named arguments:

```csharp
CalculateTax(percentage: 9.2);
```

This makes it clear that `9.2` is being passed to the `percentage` parameter.

## Rules
- If you use named arguments for one parameter, all subsequent parameters must also be passed through named arguments.
- You must supply values for all parameters unless they have default values.

## Conclusion
Named arguments enhance the readability of your code, making it easier to understand and maintain. They are particularly useful for methods with multiple parameters.
