# Lecture Summary: Static Methods

## Overview
This lecture explains static methods and how they differ from instance methods. A class can contain two types of methods: instance methods and static methods.

## Instance Methods
Instance methods are non-static methods, not declared with the `static` modifier. They are associated with objects and can manipulate instance fields.

### Example:
```csharp
public class Product {
    private int productID;
    
    public void SetProductID(int id) {
        productID = id; // Instance method
    }
}
```

## Static Methods
Static methods are declared with the `static` modifier. They are associated with the class itself and can manipulate static fields.

### Example:
```csharp
public class Product {
    private static int totalProducts;

    public static void SetTotalProducts(int total) {
        totalProducts = total; // Static method
    }
}
```

## When to Use
- **Instance Methods**: When you need to manipulate instance fields.
- **Static Methods**: When you need to manipulate static fields.

## Detailed Explanation
Static methods do not require an object to be called and are called using the class name. They cannot use the `this` keyword as they do not have a current object. 

### Example:
```csharp
Product.SetTotalProducts(10); // Calling static method
```

### Instance and Static Methods Interaction
- Instance methods can access both instance fields and static fields.
- Static methods can only access static fields directly but can access instance fields by creating an object.

### Example:
```csharp
public class Product {
    private int productID;
    private static int totalProducts;

    public static void IncrementTotalProducts() {
        totalProducts++;
    }

    public void SetProductID(int id) {
        productID = id;
    }

    public static void AccessInstanceMethod() {
        Product p = new Product();
        p.SetProductID(100); // Accessing instance method through object
    }
}
```

## Code Examples
Below are some detailed code examples extracted from the provided project files.

### Example from `ClassLibrary1`
```csharp
// Example class from ClassLibrary1
public class ExampleClass {
    private static int staticField;
    private int instanceField;

    public static void StaticMethod() {
        staticField = 10; // Static method manipulating static field
        ExampleClass example = new ExampleClass();
        example.instanceField = 20; // Accessing instance field through object
    }

    public void InstanceMethod() {
        instanceField = 30; // Instance method manipulating instance field
        staticField = 40; // Instance method manipulating static field
    }
}
```

## Conclusion
Static methods are a key feature in C# programming, allowing operations that do not require an object. They provide a way to manipulate static fields and can interact with instance fields through object creation.
