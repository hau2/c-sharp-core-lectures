# Understanding Methods

In this lecture, we will understand what a method is and how to create a method.

## Definition

A method is a collection of statements to perform a specific operation or calculation based on fields. It is part of a class and can be called from objects but is not stored inside the object.

### Example

For example, consider a class called `Car`:

```csharp
public class Car
{
    public double CalculateEmi(double carPrice, int noOfMonths, double interestRate)
    {
        // EMI calculation logic here
    }
}
```

In the above example, the `CalculateEmi` method calculates the EMI based on the car price, number of months, and interest rate. The parameters `carPrice`, `noOfMonths`, and `interestRate` are input values for this method.

## Creating a Method

To create a method, follow these steps:
1. Write the method name.
2. Specify parameters (if any) inside brackets.
3. Define the method body containing the executable statements.

### Example

```csharp
public void CalculateTax(double cost)
{
    double tax;
    if (cost <= 20000)
    {
        tax = cost * 0.1;
    }
    else
    {
        tax = cost * 0.125;
    }
    // Assign tax to a field or return it
}
```

### Access Modifiers

Access modifiers determine the accessibility of methods. The modifiers for methods are similar to those for fields and include `private`, `protected`, `internal`, `public`, etc.

### Method Modifiers

C# supports several method modifiers such as `static`, `virtual`, `abstract`, `override`, `new`, `partial`, and `sealed`. These modifiers are optional and can be used as needed.

### Return Type

The return type specifies the type of value that the method will return. If the method does not return any value, use `void` as the return type.

### Example with Return Type

```csharp
public int Add(int a, int b)
{
    return a + b;
}
```

## Example Project

Consider a project named `MethodsExample`. Below are the steps to create and use methods in this project.

### Creating a Class Library

1. Create a class library project named `ClassLibrary1`.
2. Add a class `Product` with fields and a method to calculate tax.

```csharp
public class Product
{
    public int ProductID { get; set; }
    public string ProductName { get; set; }
    public double Cost { get; set; }
    public double Tax { get; set; }

    public void CalculateTax()
    {
        if (Cost <= 20000)
        {
            Tax = Cost * 0.1;
        }
        else
        {
            Tax = Cost * 0.125;
        }
    }
}
```

### Using the Class Library in a Console Application

1. Create a console application project named `MethodsExample`.
2. Add a reference to `ClassLibrary1`.
3. Use the `Product` class and its methods.

```csharp
class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        Product product1 = new Product { ProductID = 1, ProductName = "Product1", Cost = 20000 };
        Product product2 = new Product { ProductID = 2, ProductName = "Product2", Cost = 45000 };
        Product product3 = new Product { ProductID = 3, ProductName = "Product3", Cost = 50000 };

        product1.CalculateTax();
        product2.CalculateTax();
        product3.CalculateTax();

        Console.WriteLine($"Product 1 Tax: {product1.Tax}");
        Console.WriteLine($"Product 2 Tax: {product2.Tax}");
        Console.WriteLine($"Product 3 Tax: {product3.Tax}");
    }
}
```

In this example, the `CalculateTax` method is called for each product object to calculate and display the tax based on the cost.
