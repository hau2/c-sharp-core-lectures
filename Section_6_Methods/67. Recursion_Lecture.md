# Recursion in C#

## Introduction
In this lecture, we will introduce the concept of recursion. Recursion occurs when a method calls itself. This technique is often used for solving mathematical problems and performing repetitive tasks.

## What is Recursion?
Recursion is a programming concept where a method calls itself to solve a problem. Each recursive call creates a new stack frame, storing local variables and parameters until the base condition is met, and the method starts returning results back through the call stack.

### Key Points:
- A recursive method must have a base condition to terminate.
- Each recursive call creates a new stack frame.
- Useful for solving mathematical problems like calculating factorials.

### Example
Consider a class `Sample` with a method `Factorial` that calculates the factorial of a number using recursion.

```csharp
public class Sample
{
    public double Factorial(int number)
    {
        if (number == 0)
            return 1;
        else
            return number * Factorial(number - 1);
    }
}
```

When calling this method:

```csharp
Sample s = new Sample();
double result = s.Factorial(5);
Console.WriteLine(result); // Output: 120
```

The method `Factorial` calls itself with `number - 1` until `number` reaches 0, at which point it starts returning the results back up the call stack.

### Code Illustration
```csharp
using System;

public class Sample
{
    public double Factorial(int number)
    {
        if (number == 0)
            return 1;
        else
            return number * Factorial(number - 1);
    }
}

public class Program
{
    public static void Main()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Enter a number:");
        int n = int.Parse(Console.ReadLine());

        Sample s = new Sample();
        double fact = s.Factorial(n);

        Console.WriteLine($"Factorial of {n} is {fact}");
    }
}
```

## Conclusion
Recursion is a powerful concept in programming, particularly useful for solving mathematical problems. It allows a method to call itself, breaking down a problem into smaller, more manageable parts. While recursion is useful, it should be used with care to avoid stack overflow errors and ensure that there is a base condition to terminate the recursive calls.

In the next lecture, we will explore more advanced features of C#.
