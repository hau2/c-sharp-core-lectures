# Readonly Fields in C#

In this lecture, we explore readonly fields.

## Understanding Readonly Fields

Readonly fields are similar to instance fields, but their values cannot be modified once they are set. These fields are stored inside the object and are isolated for each instance of the class.

### Key Points

- Readonly fields must be initialized either inline or in the constructor.
- Their values cannot be changed after initialization.
- They are accessed through reference variables, just like instance fields.

### Example: Product with Readonly Field

Consider a class `Product` with a readonly field `dateOfPurchase`.

```csharp
public class Product
{
    public readonly string dateOfPurchase;
    public int productID;
    public string productName;
    public double cost;

    // Constructor to initialize readonly field
    public Product(string date)
    {
        dateOfPurchase = date;
    }
}
```

In this example, `dateOfPurchase` is initialized in the constructor and cannot be changed afterward.

## Example Code

```csharp
public class Program
{
    public static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        Product product1 = new Product(System.DateTime.Now.ToShortDateString());
        Product product2 = new Product(System.DateTime.Now.ToShortDateString());

        // Display product details
        Console.WriteLine("Product 1 Date of Purchase: " + product1.dateOfPurchase);
        Console.WriteLine("Product 2 Date of Purchase: " + product2.dateOfPurchase);
    }
}
```

### Summary

- Readonly fields must be initialized at declaration or in the constructor.
- Their values cannot be changed after initialization.
- Use readonly fields for data that is unique to each object but should not change after the object is created.

Readonly fields provide a way to ensure that certain data remains constant once the object is created, while still allowing for unique values for each instance.
