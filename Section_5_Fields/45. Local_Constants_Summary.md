# Local Constants in C#

In this lecture, we explore local constants.

## Understanding Local Constants

Local constants are constants declared within a method. Unlike constant fields, local constants do not have access modifiers.

### Key Points

- Local constants must be initialized at the time of declaration.
- They are immutable and cannot be changed after initialization.
- They are accessible only within the method where they are declared.

### Example: Local Constant

Consider a method that declares a local constant `developerName`.

```csharp
public class Program
{
    public static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        const string developerName = "John Doe";
        Console.WriteLine("Developer Name: " + developerName);
    }
}
```

In this example, `developerName` is a local constant that is initialized with the value "John Doe" and cannot be changed afterward.

## Example Code

```csharp
public class Program
{
    public static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        const string developerName = "John Doe";
        Console.WriteLine("Developer Name: " + developerName);

        const int maxAttempts = 5;
        Console.WriteLine("Maximum Attempts: " + maxAttempts);

        const double pi = 3.14159;
        Console.WriteLine("Value of Pi: " + pi);
    }
}
```

### Summary

- Local constants must be initialized at declaration and cannot be changed.
- They are accessible only within the method where they are declared.
- Use local constants for values that are used within a method and should not change.

Local constants provide a way to define immutable values within a method, ensuring consistency and preventing accidental changes.
