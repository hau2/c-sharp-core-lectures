# Interface Inheritance in C#

## 1. Introduction
This lecture is about 'Interface Inheritance'.

## 2. What is Interface Inheritance?
- Interface inheritance occurs when one interface inherits from another interface.
- A child class that implements the child interface must implement all methods of both the parent and child interfaces.

## 3. Example of Interface Inheritance
### Interfaces
- **IVehicle**: Represents a vehicle with methods common to all vehicles.
- **IFlyingVehicle**: Inherits from IVehicle and adds methods specific to flying vehicles.

### Class
- **FlyingCar**: Implements IFlyingVehicle and must implement all methods from both IVehicle and IFlyingVehicle.

## 4. Syntax of Interface Inheritance
- An interface can inherit from another interface by specifying the parent interface after a colon (`:`).
- Example:
```csharp
public interface IVehicle
{
    void Drive();
}

public interface IFlyingVehicle : IVehicle
{
    void Fly();
}

public class FlyingCar : IFlyingVehicle
{
    public void Drive()
    {
        // Implementation of Drive method
    }

    public void Fly()
    {
        // Implementation of Fly method
    }
}
```

## 5. Rules of Interface Inheritance
- A child class must implement all methods from both the parent and child interfaces.
- Interface inheritance allows for logical grouping and reuse of common methods.

## 6. Code Example
Below is an example of using interface inheritance in a C# application.

```csharp
ï»¿class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        //create reference of parent interface (IEmployee)
        IEmployee emp;

        //create object of Manager
        emp = new Manager(102, "Allen", "New York", "Accounting");
        System.Console.WriteLine(emp.GetHealthInsuranceAmount()); //Manager.GetHealthInsuranceAmount
        System.Console.WriteLine();

        //create object of SalesMan
        emp = new SalesMan(103, "John", "Washington", "East");
        System.Console.WriteLine(emp.GetHealthInsuranceAmount()); //SalesMan.GetHealthInsuranceAmount
        System.Console.WriteLine();

        System.Console.ReadKey();
    }
}


```

## 7. Steps to Implement Interface Inheritance
1. Define a parent interface with common methods.
2. Define a child interface that inherits from the parent interface and adds additional methods.
3. Implement the child interface in a class, ensuring all methods from both interfaces are implemented.

## 8. Summary
- Interface inheritance allows one interface to inherit from another, creating a hierarchy of interfaces.
- It ensures that implementing classes adhere to a contract that includes methods from both the parent and child interfaces.
- This approach promotes code reuse and consistency in method implementation across different classes.

This is an overview of interface inheritance in C#. In further lectures, we will cover more advanced topics related to interfaces and inheritance.
