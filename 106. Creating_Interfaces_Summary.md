# Creating Interfaces in C#

## 1. Introduction
In this section, we will explore interfaces.

The agenda for the rest of the lectures in this section includes:
- Understanding and creating interfaces
- Understanding polymorphism and its types (static and dynamic)
- Implementation of dynamic polymorphism with interfaces
- Understanding multiple inheritance and interface inheritance
- Working with explicit interface implementation

## 2. What is an Interface?
- An interface is a 'pure abstract class' containing only abstract methods.
- Unlike abstract classes, interfaces cannot contain non-abstract methods.
- Interfaces are a set of abstract methods that must be implemented by child classes.

## 3. Syntax and Implementation
- Interfaces are defined using the `interface` keyword.
- Interface methods contain only the method signature (return type, method name, parameters) without method definitions.
- The default access modifier for interface methods is `public`.
- Child classes implement the interface methods with the `public` access modifier and must match the method signature exactly.

## 4. Real-World Examples
### Vehicle Example
- **Interface**: IVehicle
- **Child Classes**: Car, Bus

### Animal Example
- **Interface**: IAnimal
- **Child Classes**: Tiger, Dog

## 5. Rules of Interfaces
- Child classes must implement all interface methods.
- Interface methods are implicitly `public` and `abstract`.
- You cannot create objects of an interface, but you can create reference variables for interfaces.

## 6. Comparison with Abstract Classes
- Both abstract classes and interfaces can be inherited.
- Abstract classes can contain both abstract and non-abstract methods, while interfaces can only contain abstract methods.
- Abstract classes can have parent classes, but interfaces cannot.
- Interfaces can be inherited by other interfaces (interface inheritance).

## 7. Code Example
Below is an example of using interfaces in a C# application.

```csharp
ï»¿class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        //create object of Manager
        Manager mgr1 = new Manager(102, "Allen", "New York", "Accounting");
        System.Console.WriteLine("Object of Child class (Manager):");
        System.Console.WriteLine(mgr1.EmpID);
        System.Console.WriteLine(mgr1.EmpName);
        System.Console.WriteLine(mgr1.Location);
        System.Console.WriteLine(mgr1.DepartmentName);
        System.Console.WriteLine(mgr1.GetTotalSalesOfTheYear());
        System.Console.WriteLine(mgr1.GetFullDepartmentName());
        System.Console.WriteLine(mgr1.GetHealthInsuranceAmount()); //Manager.GetHealthInsuranceAmount
        System.Console.WriteLine();

        //create object of SalesMan
        SalesMan salesMan1 = new SalesMan(103, "John", "Washington", "East");
        System.Console.WriteLine("Object of Child class (SalesMan):");
        System.Console.WriteLine(salesMan1.EmpID);
        System.Console.WriteLine(salesMan1.EmpName);
        System.Console.WriteLine(salesMan1.Location);
        System.Console.WriteLine(salesMan1.Region);
        System.Console.WriteLine(salesMan1.GetSalesOfTheCurrentMonth());
        System.Console.WriteLine(salesMan1.GetHealthInsuranceAmount()); //SalesMan.GetHealthInsuranceAmount
        System.Console.WriteLine();

        System.Console.ReadKey();
    }
}


```

## 8. Summary
- Interfaces provide a set of abstract methods that must be implemented by child classes.
- Use interfaces when you want to enforce a method signature without providing any implementation.
- Interfaces ensure that all child classes implement specific methods, providing consistency across different classes.

This is an overview of creating and using interfaces in C#. In further lectures, we will cover advanced topics related to interfaces.
