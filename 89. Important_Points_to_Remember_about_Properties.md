## Lecture: Important Points to Remember about Properties

### Overview
This lecture covers the essential points about properties in C#. Properties are a crucial aspect of encapsulation, providing a way to access private fields safely.

### Key Points

1. **Use of Properties**: 
   - Always use properties in real-time projects instead of accessing fields directly.
   - Make fields private and use public properties to access them.

2. **Automatic Properties**:
   - Use automatic properties when no specific validation logic is needed.
   - Simplifies the code by avoiding explicit get and set accessor definitions.

3. **Memory and Storage**:
   - Properties do not occupy memory and are not stored in the object.
   - They act like methods, copying values to corresponding fields.

4. **Role of Fields**:
   - Fields store the actual value.
   - Properties are an outer layer that protects fields.

5. **Read-only and Write-only Properties**:
   - Read-only properties have only a get accessor.
   - Write-only properties have only a set accessor.
   - Read-only properties can be read multiple times but not written to.
   - Write-only properties can be written to multiple times but not read from.

6. **Access Rules**:
   - These rules apply to properties, not the underlying fields.
   - Fields can be read or written within the same class without restrictions.

7. **Set Accessor**:
   - Contains a default parameter called 'value', representing the value passed by the user.
   - Properties cannot have additional parameters.

8. **Usage Summary**:
   - Fields: Store values.
   - Properties: Validate or calculate values.
   - Methods: Manipulate fields.
   - Constructors: Initialize fields.

### Example Code

#### Using Properties
```csharp
public class Employee
{
    private string name;
    public string Name
    {
        get { return name; }
        set { name = value; }
    }
}

// Usage in Main Method
class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        Employee emp = new Employee();
        emp.Name = "John Doe"; // Using set accessor
        Console.WriteLine(emp.Name); // Using get accessor
    }
}
```

#### Read-only and Write-only Properties
```csharp
public class Employee
{
    private string name;
    public string Name
    {
        get { return name; }
    }

    private int id;
    public int Id
    {
        set { id = value; }
    }
}

// Usage in Main Method
class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        Employee emp = new Employee();
        // emp.Name = "John Doe"; // Error: Cannot assign to read-only property
        Console.WriteLine(emp.Name); // Allowed

        emp.Id = 123; // Allowed
        // Console.WriteLine(emp.Id); // Error: Cannot read from write-only property
    }
}
```

### Summary
Properties are a fundamental part of C# for encapsulating and protecting fields. They provide a controlled way to access and modify private fields, ensuring that any necessary validation or calculation is performed.
