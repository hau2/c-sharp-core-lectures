# Summary of Generic Methods in C#

## Overview
This document summarizes the concept of generic methods in C# based on the provided resources.

## Generic Methods
In C#, you can create generic methods that accept generic type parameters, allowing the methods to operate with different data types.

### Benefits
- Flexibility to handle various data types with a single method.
- Useful when the type of data to be processed is not known in advance.

## Example Usage
### Defining a Generic Method
Assume we have two classes, `Employee` and `Student`, each with a field: `Salary` and `Marks`, respectively.

#### Class Definition
```csharp
public class Employee
{
    public int Salary { get; set; }
}

public class Student
{
    public int Marks { get; set; }
}
```

#### Generic Method in a Non-Generic Class
A class `Sample` contains a generic method `PrintData` that accepts a parameter of a generic type `T`.
```csharp
public class Sample
{
    public void PrintData<T>(T obj) where T : class
    {
        if (obj is Student student)
        {
            Console.WriteLine(student.Marks);
        }
        else if (obj is Employee employee)
        {
            Console.WriteLine(employee.Salary);
        }
    }
}
```

### Main Method
In the `Main` method, objects of `Employee` and `Student` are created and used with the `PrintData` generic method.
```csharp
var sample = new Sample();
var employee = new Employee { Salary = 5000 };
var student = new Student { Marks = 90 };

sample.PrintData(employee);  // Output: 5000
sample.PrintData(student);   // Output: 90
```

## Conclusion
Generic methods in C# provide a powerful way to write flexible and reusable code that can handle different types of parameters. They are particularly useful in scenarios where the type of data to be processed is not known in advance.
