# Summary of Multiple Generic Parameters in C#

## Overview
This document summarizes the concept of using multiple generic parameters in C# based on the provided resources.

## Class Definition
The example explains how to define a class with multiple generic type parameters. Initially, there is a class with a single generic type parameter `T` used for `RegistrationStatus`. A second generic type parameter `T2` is introduced to handle the user's age, which can be either an exact age (e.g., 20, 21) or an approximate age range (e.g., 35-40).

## Generic Type Parameters
- **T1**: Represents the type for `RegistrationStatus`.
- **T2**: Represents the type for `Age`.

These parameters can be of different data types or the same data type.

## Example Usage
### Exact Age
For an exact age, both `RegistrationStatus` and `Age` can be integers.
```csharp
var user1 = new User<int, int>()
{
    RegistrationStatus = 1,
    Age = 22
};
```

### Approximate Age
For an approximate age, `RegistrationStatus` is an integer and `Age` is a string.
```csharp
var user2 = new User<int, string>()
{
    RegistrationStatus = 1,
    Age = "35-40"
};
```

## Main Method
In the `Main` method, two objects are created to demonstrate the usage of the generic parameters:
1. `user1` with exact age (int).
2. `user2` with approximate age (string).

## Conclusion
This approach allows the flexibility to store different types of age information using generic type parameters in C#.
