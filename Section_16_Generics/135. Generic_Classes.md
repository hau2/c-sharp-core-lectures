# Generic Classes in C#

This section is all about generics in C#.

## Agenda
- Understanding the generic classes
- Generic constraints
- Generic methods

## Generic Classes

The generic class is a class where the field's data type can be changed with respect to various objects. While creating an object for the generic class, you will pass a data type as an argument. This data type can be used as the data type of the field.

### Example
For example, for the first object, you might pass an `int` as an argument. The data type `int` is represented as `T`, where "T" stands for "Type". This `T` is used as the data type for the field.

```csharp
public class GenericClass<T>
{
    public T Field;
}

var obj1 = new GenericClass<int> { Field = 1234 };
var obj2 = new GenericClass<string> { Field = "Hello" };
```

In this example, `obj1` uses `int` for the field, and `obj2` uses `string` for the field.

### Real-World Use Case
Consider a class `User` with a field `RegistrationStatus`. The type of `RegistrationStatus` can be different for different instances of `User`:

```csharp
public class User<T>
{
    public T RegistrationStatus;
}

var registeredUser = new User<int> { RegistrationStatus = 1234 };
var unregisteredUser = new User<bool> { RegistrationStatus = false };
```

## Benefits of Generic Classes
- **Flexibility**: Store various types of fields with respect to various objects.
- **Type Safety**: Avoids the need for typecasting and allows the compiler to enforce type safety.
- **Code Reusability**: Generic classes are more reusable because they are not tied to a specific data type.

### Code from the Example

**Class1.cs**
```csharp
public class GenericClass<T>
{
    public T Field;
}
```

**Program.cs**
```csharp
class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        var registeredUser = new User<int> { RegistrationStatus = 1234 };
        var unregisteredUser = new User<bool> { RegistrationStatus = false };
        
        Console.WriteLine($"Registered User Application No: {registeredUser.RegistrationStatus}");
        Console.WriteLine($"Unregistered User Status: {unregisteredUser.RegistrationStatus}");
    }
}
```

### Key Points
- The generic type parameter `T` can be any letter.
- You can have multiple generic type parameters separated by a comma, e.g., `T1, T2, T3`.
- Introduced in C# 2.0.

In the next lecture, you will learn how to create multiple generic type parameters.
