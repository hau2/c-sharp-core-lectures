# Readonly and Writeonly Properties in C#

## Introduction


## Readonly Properties
A readonly property in C# is a property that contains only a `get` accessor, allowing you to read the property's value but not modify it. This is useful when you want to allow users to read a field's value but prevent them from modifying it.

### Example
```csharp
public class Employee
{
    private double _salary;

    public Employee(double salary)
    {
        _salary = salary;
    }

    public double Salary // Readonly property
    {
        get { return _salary; }
    }
}
```

### Usage
```csharp
Employee emp = new Employee(1000);
Console.WriteLine(emp.Salary); // Allowed: Reading the value
emp.Salary = 2000; // Not Allowed: Modifying the value
```

## Writeonly Properties
A writeonly property in C# is a property that contains only a `set` accessor, allowing you to assign a value to the property but not read it. This is useful when you want to allow users to modify a field's value but prevent them from reading it.

### Example
```csharp
public class BankAccount
{
    private double _interestRate;

    public double InterestRate // Writeonly property
    {
        set
        {
            if (value >= 0 && value <= 100) // Validation logic
                _interestRate = value;
        }
    }
}
```

### Usage
```csharp
BankAccount account = new BankAccount();
account.InterestRate = 5; // Allowed: Setting the value
Console.WriteLine(account.InterestRate); // Not Allowed: Reading the value
```

## Combining Readonly and Writeonly Properties
### Example
```csharp
public class Employee
{
    private int _empID;
    private double _tax;

    public int EmpID // Readonly property
    {
        get { return _empID; }
    }

    public double Tax // Writeonly property
    {
        set
        {
            if (value >= 0 && value <= 100) // Validation logic
                _tax = value;
        }
    }

    public double CalculateNetSalary()
    {
        return _empID - _tax; // Using both fields
    }
}
```

### Usage
```csharp
Employee emp = new Employee();
emp.Tax = 10; // Allowed: Setting the value
double netSalary = emp.CalculateNetSalary();
Console.WriteLine(netSalary); // Allowed: Reading the calculated value
```

## Conclusion
Readonly and writeonly properties in C# provide a way to control how fields in a class are accessed and modified, allowing for better encapsulation and data validation.
