## What is the order of initialization for auto-implemented properties in C#?
Auto-implemented properties are initialized in the order they are declared in the class, from top to bottom. Ensure that dependent properties are initialized after the properties they rely on.

## Are there any limitations or restrictions when initializing auto-implemented properties in C#?
Yes, there are some limitations:
- You cannot use the 'this' keyword in the initializer of an auto-implemented property.
- You cannot use the value of other properties or fields in the same class as part of the initializer.
- The initializer must be a constant or a compile-time expression.
- The order of initialization is crucial.

## What are events in C# and how are they different from delegates?
Events in C# are a way to provide notifications, and they are based on delegates. They allow an object to notify other objects when something of interest occurs.

### Key Differences:
- **Access Control**: Events provide additional encapsulation and access control over delegates.
- **Subscription Management**: Events control how delegates are added or removed.

## How do you declare and raise an event in C#?
To declare an event, use the 'event' keyword followed by a delegate type and the event name. To raise an event, invoke the delegate if it is not null.

## What are the best practices for using events in C#?
- Use event handlers that follow the standard EventHandler pattern.
- Avoid raising events in the constructor.
- Ensure events are thread-safe.
- Unsubscribe from events to avoid memory leaks.

## What is the EventHandler delegate in C#?
The EventHandler delegate is a predefined delegate type that represents an event handler method. It has a specific signature with two parameters: an object sender and an EventArgs parameter.

## How do you create custom event data in C#?
To create custom event data, define a class that inherits from EventArgs and add the necessary properties.

## What are anonymous methods and lambda expressions in C#?
Anonymous methods and lambda expressions provide a way to define inline methods without a named identifier. They are used to create delegates or expression tree types.

### Anonymous Methods:
- Declared using the 'delegate' keyword.
- Provide a way to pass a code block as a delegate.

### Lambda Expressions:
- Provide a more concise syntax than anonymous methods.
- Use the '=>' operator to separate the input parameters and the body.

## What is the difference between anonymous methods and lambda expressions in C#?
Lambda expressions are a more concise and expressive way to write inline methods compared to anonymous methods. They also support expression trees, making them suitable for LINQ queries.

## What are expression trees in C#?
Expression trees represent code in a tree-like data structure, where each node is an expression. They are used in LINQ to represent queries that can be translated to other formats, such as SQL.

## How do you create and compile expression trees in C#?
To create expression trees, use the System.Linq.Expressions namespace. To compile an expression tree into a delegate, call the Compile method on the expression.

## What are the advantages and disadvantages of using expression trees in C#?
### Advantages:
- Enable the creation of dynamic queries.
- Allow for the manipulation of code as data.

### Disadvantages:
- Can be complex and harder to debug.
- May have a performance overhead.

## What is the purpose of the 'dynamic' keyword in C#?
The 'dynamic' keyword allows for dynamic typing, where the type is resolved at runtime instead of compile time. It provides more flexibility but sacrifices type safety and IntelliSense support.

## When should you use the 'dynamic' keyword in C#?
Use the 'dynamic' keyword when working with COM objects, dynamic languages, or scenarios where type information is not available at compile time.

## What are the risks associated with using the 'dynamic' keyword in C#?
- Lack of compile-time type checking.
- Potential for runtime errors.
- Reduced performance compared to statically typed code.

## How do you use the 'dynamic' keyword in C#?
Declare a variable with the 'dynamic' keyword, and assign values to it. The type is resolved at runtime.

## What is the ExpandoObject class in C#?
The ExpandoObject class allows for the creation of dynamic objects with members that can be added or removed at runtime.

## How do you use the ExpandoObject class in C#?
To use the ExpandoObject class, create an instance and add members to it using the IDictionary interface or dynamic properties.
