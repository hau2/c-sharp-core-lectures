# Constant Fields in C#

In this lecture, we explore constant fields.

## Understanding Constant Fields

Constant fields are similar to static fields in that they are common to all objects of a class. However, constant fields are immutableâ€”they cannot be changed after they are initialized.

### Key Points

- Constant fields must be initialized at the time of declaration.
- They cannot be assigned a new value later.
- They are accessed using the class name.
- At compile time, the constant value replaces the constant name in the code.

### Example: Product Category

Consider a class `Product` with a constant field `CategoryName`.

```csharp
public class Product
{
    public const string CategoryName = "Electronics";

    public int productID;
    public string productName;
    public double cost;
}
```

In this example, `CategoryName` is common to all products and has a fixed value of "Electronics".

## Example Code

```csharp
public class Program
{
    public static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        Product product1 = new Product { productID = 1, productName = "Laptop", cost = 1000.0 };
        Product product2 = new Product { productID = 2, productName = "Smartphone", cost = 500.0 };

        // Accessing constant field using class name
        Console.WriteLine("Category: " + Product.CategoryName);

        // Display product details
        Console.WriteLine("Product 1: " + product1.productName + " (" + Product.CategoryName + ")");
        Console.WriteLine("Product 2: " + product2.productName + " (" + Product.CategoryName + ")");
    }
}
```

### Local Constants

Constants can also be declared inside a method, where they are known as local constants.

```csharp
public class Program
{
    public static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        const int maxProducts = 100;
        Console.WriteLine("Maximum Products: " + maxProducts);
    }
}
```

### Summary

- Constants are immutable and must be initialized at declaration.
- They are accessed using the class name, similar to static fields.
- Use constants for values that are common to all instances of a class and will not change.

Constant fields provide a way to define values that are shared across all instances of a class and are guaranteed to remain unchanged.
