# Creating Structures in C#

## Understanding Value Types and Reference Types

In C#, you can classify types into two categories: value types and reference types. 

- **Value Types:** These are meant for storing simple values and include structures and enumerations. Instances of value types are stored in the stack.
- **Reference Types:** These are meant for storing complex data and include strings, classes, interfaces, and delegates. Instances of reference types are stored in the heap.

### Key Differences:
- Value types are stored in the stack and are accessed faster.
- Reference types are stored in the heap and are used for complex data storage.

## Structures in C#

### Creating a Structure
A structure is created using the `struct` keyword. Structures can have fields, methods, constructors, properties, and events, similar to classes. However, structures are value types and are meant for limited fields, typically one or two.

### Example:
```csharp
public struct Category
{
    private int _CategoryId;
    private string _CategoryName;

    public int CategoryId
    {
        get { return _CategoryId; }
        set 
        { 
            if (value > 0 && value <= 100)
                _CategoryId = value; 
        }
    }

    public string CategoryName
    {
        get { return _CategoryName; }
        set 
        { 
            if (value.Length <= 40)
                _CategoryName = value; 
        }
    }

    public int GetCategoryNameLength()
    {
        return _CategoryName.Length;
    }
}
```

### When to Use Structures
- Use structures for simple data storage with one or two fields.
- Structures are faster as they are stored in the stack.
- Classes should be used for complex data storage and when inheritance is needed.

### Key Points:
- Structures do not support inheritance.
- Structures can implement interfaces.
- Structures do not support parameter-less constructors.
- Instances of structures are called structure instances and are stored in the stack.
- Structures are derived from `System.ValueType`.

### Practical Implementation
1. **Creating a Structure Instance:**
    ```csharp
    Category category = new Category();
    category.CategoryId = 20;
    category.CategoryName = "General";
    int nameLength = category.GetCategoryNameLength();
    ```

2. **Constraints:**
    - All fields must be initialized.
    - Structures cannot have destructors or support inheritance.

## Extracted Files
The provided zip file contains a solution and projects demonstrating the use of structures in C#. The solution includes a `ClassLibrary1` with the structure definition and a console application to test the structure.

- **Solution File:** StructuresExample.sln
- **Projects:**
    - ClassLibrary1
    - StructuresExample

These projects include practical examples of creating and using structures, adhering to the principles outlined above.

### Running the Example
Open the `StructuresExample.sln` solution in Visual Studio. The `ClassLibrary1` project contains the `Category` structure definition, and the `StructuresExample` project demonstrates how to create and use structure instances.

## Conclusion
Structures in C# are powerful for storing simple, related data. They provide performance benefits by being stored in the stack and ensure type safety. However, for complex data storage and scenarios requiring inheritance, classes are more appropriate.
