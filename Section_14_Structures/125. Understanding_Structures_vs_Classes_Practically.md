# Understanding Structures vs Classes in C# - Practical Examples

## Structures vs Classes

This lecture covers the difference between assigning a value to a structure variable and a reference variable of a class.

### Creating Structures and Classes

In this example, we create a structure named `Structure1` and a class named `Class1`. Both have two public fields, `x` and `y`.

### Structure Example
```csharp
public struct Structure1
{
    public int x;
    public int y;
}
```

### Class Example
```csharp
public class Class1
{
    public int x;
    public int y;
}
```

### Experiment in Program.cs

```csharp
class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        // Structure example
        Structure1 struct1 = new Structure1();
        struct1.x = 10;
        struct1.y = 20;

        Structure1 struct2 = struct1;
        struct2.x = 100;
        struct2.y = 200;

        Console.WriteLine($"struct1: x={struct1.x}, y={struct1.y}");
        Console.WriteLine($"struct2: x={struct2.x}, y={struct2.y}");

        // Class example
        Class1 class1 = new Class1();
        class1.x = 10;
        class1.y = 20;

        Class1 class2 = class1;
        class2.x = 100;
        class2.y = 200;

        Console.WriteLine($"class1: x={class1.x}, y={class1.y}");
        Console.WriteLine($"class2: x={class2.x}, y={class2.y}");
    }
}
```

### Key Points
- **Structures** are value types and are stored in the stack. When you copy a structure, you copy all its data.
- **Classes** are reference types and are stored in the heap. When you copy a class, you copy the reference to the object, not the object itself.

### Expected Output
```
struct1: x=10, y=20
struct2: x=100, y=200
class1: x=100, y=200
class2: x=100, y=200
```

### Practical Implementation

The provided zip file contains a solution and projects demonstrating the practical differences between structures and classes in C#. The solution includes a `ClassLibrary1` with the structure and class definitions and a console application to test them.

- **Solution File:** StructuresExample2.sln
- **Projects:**
    - ClassLibrary1
    - StructuresExample2

These projects include practical examples of creating and using structures and classes, adhering to the principles outlined above.

### Running the Example

Open the `StructuresExample2.sln` solution in Visual Studio. The `ClassLibrary1` project contains the `Structure1` and `Class1` definitions, and the `StructuresExample2` project demonstrates how to create and use structure and class instances.

## Conclusion

Understanding the difference between structures and classes in C# is crucial for efficient memory management and performance optimization. Structures are suitable for small, simple data types, while classes are better for complex data that requires reference semantics.
