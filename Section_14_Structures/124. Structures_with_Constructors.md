# Structures with Constructors in C#

## Parameterized Constructors in Structures

In C#, structures cannot have user-defined parameterless constructors, but they can have parameterized constructors. The rule for parameterized constructors in structures is that all fields must be initialized, otherwise a compile-time error will occur.

### Example:
```csharp
public struct Category
{
    private int _CategoryId;
    private string _CategoryName;

    public int CategoryId
    {
        get { return _CategoryId; }
        set 
        { 
            if (value > 0 && value <= 100)
                _CategoryId = value; 
        }
    }

    public string CategoryName
    {
        get { return _CategoryName; }
        set 
        { 
            if (value.Length <= 40)
                _CategoryName = value; 
        }
    }

    public Category(int categoryId, string categoryName)
    {
        _CategoryId = categoryId;
        _CategoryName = categoryName;
    }

    public int GetCategoryNameLength()
    {
        return _CategoryName.Length;
    }
}
```

### Key Points:
- In a parameterized constructor, all fields must be initialized.
- The `new` keyword is used to call the parameterized constructor but does not create an object in the heap.

### Practical Implementation
1. **Creating a Structure Instance with Parameterized Constructor:**
    ```csharp
    Category category = new Category(20, "General");
    int nameLength = category.GetCategoryNameLength();
    ```

2. **Constraints:**
    - All fields must be initialized in the parameterized constructor.

## Extracted Files
The provided zip file contains a solution and projects demonstrating the use of parameterized constructors in structures in C#. The solution includes a `ClassLibrary1` with the structure definition and a console application to test the structure.

- **Solution File:** StructuresExample.sln
- **Projects:**
    - ClassLibrary1
    - StructuresExample

These projects include practical examples of creating and using parameterized constructors in structures, adhering to the principles outlined above.

### Running the Example
Open the `StructuresExample.sln` solution in Visual Studio. The `ClassLibrary1` project contains the `Category` structure definition with a parameterized constructor, and the `StructuresExample` project demonstrates how to create and use structure instances with the constructor.

## Conclusion
Parameterized constructors in structures allow for the initialization of fields at the time of instance creation. This ensures that the structure instance is fully initialized and ready for use. The constraints ensure type safety and consistent behavior of structure instances.
