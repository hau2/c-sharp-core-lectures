# Primitive Types as Structures in C#

## Overview

In C#, all primitive types except `string` are implemented as structures. This includes types like `sbyte`, `byte`, `short`, `ushort`, `int`, `uint`, `long`, `ulong`, `float`, `double`, `decimal`, `char`, and `bool`. These types are treated as structure instances to maintain type safety.

### Key Points
- **Type Safety:** Variables of a specific type can only store values of that type.
- **Structures:** Primitive types are implemented as structures to enforce type safety.

## Examples

### Declaration
When you declare a variable of a primitive type, it is treated as a structure instance.
```csharp
sbyte x = 10; // sbyte is a structure
```

### Equivalents
- `sbyte` is equivalent to `System.SByte`
- `int` is equivalent to `System.Int32`
- `long` is equivalent to `System.Int64`
- `float` is equivalent to `System.Single`
- `bool` is equivalent to `System.Boolean`
- ...

### String vs. string
- `string` (lowercase) is the C# keyword.
- `String` (PascalCase) is the .NET Framework class `System.String`.

Both are equivalent:
```csharp
string str1 = "Hello";
String str2 = "World";
```

## Conclusion

Understanding that primitive types in C# are implemented as structures helps in appreciating the language's type safety features. This ensures that variables of a specific type can only store values of that type, preventing type-related errors and improving code reliability.
