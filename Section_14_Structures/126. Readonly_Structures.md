# Readonly Structures in C#

## Overview

Readonly structures is a new feature in C# 8.0. In readonly structures, all members must be readonly, including fields, properties, and methods. The only exception is constructors, which can initialize the fields.

### Benefits
- Improved performance: Since all operations are read-only, they are faster compared to write operations.
- Ensures immutability: Once initialized, the values cannot be changed.

## Creating a Readonly Structure

### Example
```csharp
public readonly struct Marvel
{
    private readonly string characterName;

    public Marvel(string name)
    {
        characterName = name;
    }

    public string CharacterName => characterName;

    public string GetCharacterInfo()
    {
        return $"Character: {characterName}";
    }
}
```

### Key Points
- Fields, properties, and methods must be readonly.
- Constructors can initialize fields.
- Methods can only read the values, not modify them.

### Practical Implementation

1. **Creating a Readonly Structure Instance:**
    ```csharp
    Marvel thanos = new Marvel("Thanos");
    Console.WriteLine(thanos.CharacterName);
    Console.WriteLine(thanos.GetCharacterInfo());
    ```

2. **Constraints:**
    - Attempting to modify a field or property outside the constructor will result in a compile-time error.

## Conclusion

Readonly structures in C# provide a way to ensure immutability and improve performance. They are useful when you want to create structures where the values should not be modified after initialization.
