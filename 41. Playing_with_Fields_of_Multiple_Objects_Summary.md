# Playing with Fields of Multiple Objects in C#

In this example, we explore how to work with multiple objects and access their fields.

## Creating Multiple Objects

We create three objects of the `Product` class.

```csharp
Product product1 = new Product();
Product product2 = new Product();
Product product3 = new Product();
```

Each object is stored in the heap and its address is stored in the respective reference variables: `product1`, `product2`, and `product3`.

## Accessing Fields of Multiple Objects

To access or manipulate the fields of these objects, use the reference variables.

For example, to access the `quantityInStock` field of the first object:

```csharp
int quantity1 = product1.quantityInStock;
```

To sum the quantities of all objects and store in a local variable `totalQuantity`:

```csharp
int totalQuantity = product1.quantityInStock + product2.quantityInStock + product3.quantityInStock;
Console.WriteLine("Total Quantity: " + totalQuantity);
```

### Example Code

```csharp
public class Product
{
    public int quantityInStock;
    public int cost;

    public Product(int quantity, int cost)
    {
        this.quantityInStock = quantity;
        this.cost = cost;
    }
}

public class Program
{
    public static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        Product product1 = new Product(1200, 20000);
        Product product2 = new Product(3400, 45000);
        Product product3 = new Product(800, 36000);

        int totalQuantity = product1.quantityInStock + product2.quantityInStock + product3.quantityInStock;
        Console.WriteLine("Total Quantity: " + totalQuantity);

        int highestCost = Math.Max(product1.cost, Math.Max(product2.cost, product3.cost));
        Console.WriteLine("Highest Cost: " + highestCost);
    }
}
```

## Assignment

Find out the highest cost among all three products programmatically using the `if` statement or `Math.Max` function.

### Example Code for Assignment

```csharp
int highestCost = product1.cost;

if (product2.cost > highestCost)
{
    highestCost = product2.cost;
}

if (product3.cost > highestCost)
{
    highestCost = product3.cost;
}

Console.WriteLine("Highest Cost: " + highestCost);
```

By practicing this, you will understand how to handle multiple objects and perform operations on their fields.
