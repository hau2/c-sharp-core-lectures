# Sealed Classes in C#

## Introduction
A sealed class is a class that cannot be inherited. To define a sealed class, use the `sealed` modifier. Sealed classes are useful in scenarios where you want to prevent other developers from inheriting and extending your class.

## Definition
- A sealed class cannot be inherited.
- A sealed class can inherit from other classes and implement interfaces.
- Sealed classes can have both static and non-static members, but they cannot contain virtual methods.

## Example Code

### Defining a Sealed Class
```csharp
public sealed class Manager
{
    public int ID { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }

    public void Display()
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"ID: {ID}, Name: {Name}");
    }
}
```

### Attempting to Inherit from a Sealed Class (Compile-Time Error)
```csharp
public class BranchManager : Manager
{
    // This will cause a compile-time error because Manager is sealed.
}
```

## Behavior of Sealed Classes
- A sealed class can be instantiated like a normal class.
- A sealed class can inherit from other classes and implement interfaces.
- Other classes cannot inherit from a sealed class, ensuring that the class's implementation remains unchanged.

## Use Case
Sealed classes are often used for security and performance reasons. By preventing inheritance, you ensure that the behavior of your class remains consistent and unmodified.

### Example of a Sealed Class Implementing an Interface
```csharp
public interface IEmployee
{
    void ShowDetails();
}

public sealed class Manager : IEmployee
{
    public int ID { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }

    public void ShowDetails()
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"ID: {ID}, Name: {Name}");
    }
}

public class Program
{
    public static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        Manager mgr = new Manager { ID = 1, Name = "John Doe" };
        mgr.ShowDetails(); // Output: ID: 1, Name: John Doe
    }
}
```

## Conclusion
Sealed classes are a useful feature in C# for preventing inheritance and ensuring that your class's implementation remains secure and unchanged. They provide a simple way to control the extensibility of your classes.
