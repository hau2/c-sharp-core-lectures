# Lesson Summary: Importing Namespaces in C#

## Overview
This lesson covers the concept of importing namespaces in C# using the `using` directive. By importing namespaces, you can access classes and other types within those namespaces without needing to repeatedly specify the namespace.

## Key Concepts

### Using Directive
- The `using` directive allows you to import a namespace, making its classes and types accessible without specifying the namespace repeatedly.
- Syntax: `using <NamespaceName>;`

### Example
- Suppose we have a namespace `HR` with an inner namespace `Mgr`. We create multiple objects of the `Manager` class, which is a member of `HR.Mgr`.
- Without the `using` directive, you must specify the full namespace every time you create an object, leading to repetition.

### Benefits
- Reduces the need to repeatedly write the full namespace, making the code cleaner and more readable.
- If you need to use classes or interfaces from a namespace multiple times, importing it at the top of the file saves time and effort.

### Importing Multiple Namespaces
- Each `using` statement imports a single namespace.
- To import multiple namespaces, you need separate `using` statements for each.

### Scope of Using Directive
- The `using` statements must be at the top of the file, outside of any method.
- Importing a namespace only makes its classes and interfaces accessible, not its inner namespaces.

## Code Examples

### Program.cs
```csharp
using HR;
using HR.Mgr;
using FrontOffice;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        //creating objects of Manager class
        IManager manager1;
        manager1 = new Manager();

        IManager manager2;
        manager2 = new Manager();

        IManager manager3;
        manager3 = new Manager();

        //Creating objects of CustomerEnquiry class
        CustomerEnquiry customerEnquiry = new CustomerEnquiry();

        System.Console.ReadKey();
    }
}
```

### HR.cs
```csharp
namespace HR
{
    namespace Mgr
    {
        //interface that represents a manager, which inherits from IEmployee
        public interface IManager : IEmployee
        {
        }

        //class that represents a manager, which inherits from IManager
        public class Manager : IManager
        {
        }

        //class that represents an assistant manager, which inherits from IManager
        public class AsstManager : IManager
        {
        }
    }

    //interface that represents an employee in the organization
    public interface IEmployee
    {
    }

    //interface that represents an executive, which inherits from IEmployee
    public interface IExecutive : IEmployee
    {
    }

    //class that represents an executive, which inherits from IExecutive
    public class Executive : IExecutive
    {
    }
}
```

## Conclusion
The `using` directive in C# is a powerful feature that simplifies code by allowing the import of namespaces. This reduces redundancy and makes the code more readable and maintainable. By understanding and using the `using` directive effectively, you can write cleaner and more efficient C# programs.
