# Access Modifiers in C#

Access modifiers are keywords used to specify the declared accessibility of a member or a type. This determines where the member can be used.

## Types of Access Modifiers

1. **Private**: The member is accessible only within the body of the class or the struct in which it is declared.
2. **Protected**: The member is accessible within its class and by derived class instances.
3. **Internal**: The member is accessible within the same assembly, but not from another assembly.
4. **Protected Internal**: The member is accessible within its class and by derived class instances in the same assembly.
5. **Private Protected**: The member is accessible by types derived from the containing class, but only within its containing assembly.
6. **Public**: The member is accessible from any other code.

## Example Code

Let's consider the `Product` class and its derived classes.

```csharp
// Parent class
public class Product
{
    private int productID;
    protected string productName;
    internal double cost;
    protected internal int quantityInStock;
    private protected bool isAvailable;
    public string description;
}

// Child class in the same assembly
public class DomesticProduct : Product
{
    public void Display()
    {
        // Can access protected and protected internal members
        productName = "Domestic Product";
        quantityInStock = 100;
        // Can access internal members
        cost = 20.5;
        // Can access private protected members
        isAvailable = true;
    }
}

// Child class in another assembly
public class InternationalProduct : Product
{
    public void Display()
    {
        // Can access protected and protected internal members
        productName = "International Product";
        quantityInStock = 200;
        // Cannot access internal members
        // cost = 30.5; // Error
        // Cannot access private protected members
        // isAvailable = false; // Error
    }
}

// Other class in the same assembly
public class OtherClass
{
    public void Display()
    {
        Product product = new Product();
        // Cannot access private and protected members
        // product.productID = 1; // Error
        // product.productName = "Other"; // Error
        // Can access internal and protected internal members
        product.cost = 10.5;
        product.quantityInStock = 50;
        // Cannot access private protected members
        // product.isAvailable = false; // Error
        // Can access public members
        product.description = "Other Class";
    }
}

// Other class in another assembly
public class AnotherClass
{
    public void Display()
    {
        Product product = new Product();
        // Cannot access private, protected, internal, and private protected members
        // product.productID = 1; // Error
        // product.productName = "Another"; // Error
        // product.cost = 10.5; // Error
        // product.isAvailable = false; // Error
        // Can access protected internal members through inheritance
        // Cannot access protected internal members directly
        // product.quantityInStock = 100; // Error
        // Can access public members
        product.description = "Another Class";
    }
}
```

## Summary

- **Private**: Accessible within the same class only.
- **Protected**: Accessible within the same class and derived classes.
- **Internal**: Accessible within the same assembly.
- **Protected Internal**: Accessible within the same assembly and derived classes in other assemblies.
- **Private Protected**: Accessible within the same class and derived classes in the same assembly.
- **Public**: Accessible everywhere.

Understanding these access modifiers helps in designing a secure and well-encapsulated code structure.
