## Partial Classes
Partial Class is a class that splits into multiple files.
Each file is treated as a "part of the class".

### Key Points
- At compilation time, all partial classes that have the same name become a "single class".
- All the partial classes (that want to be a part of a class) should have the same name, be in the same namespace, same assembly, and have the same access modifier (such as 'internal' or 'public').
- Duplicate members are not allowed in partial classes.
- Any attributes or modifiers (such as abstract, sealed) applied to one partial class will be applied to all partial classes that have the same name.
- The 'partial' keyword can only be used before the keywords 'class', 'struct', 'interface', and 'void'.
- Each partial class can be developed individually by different developers or teams.
- In WinForms/WebForms, the 'Designer-generated code' will be kept in one partial class; the 'code written by developer' will be kept in another partial class with the same name; so both become a single class at compilation time.

## Partial Methods
Partial Methods are "declared in one partial class" (just like an abstract method) and "implemented in another partial class" that has the same name.

### Key Points
- Assume there are two developers; the first developer develops the first partial class, and the second developer develops the second partial class.
- The partial method lets the first developer declare a partial method in one partial class, and the second developer implements the partial method in the other partial class.
- Partial Methods can only be created in partial classes or partial structs.
- Partial Methods are implicitly private and can't have any other access modifier.
- Partial Methods can only have a "void" return type.
- Implementation of partial methods is optional. If there is no implementation of partial methods in any parts of the partial class, the method calls are removed by the compiler at compilation time.
- If you are building large class libraries and decide to extend methods to other developers, partial methods can be used.

## Static Classes
Static class is a class that can contain only "static members".
If you don't want even a single 'instance member' (non-static member), then use a 'static class'.

### Advantage
- We can avoid the accidental creation of an object for the class by making it a "static class".

### Syntax
```csharp
static class ClassName
{
  static fields
  static methods
  static constructors
  static properties
  static events
}
```

### Static Classes vs. Normal Classes
#### Static Class:
```csharp
static class ClassName
{
   static fields
   static methods
   static constructors
   static properties
   static events
}
```
Static class is to create ONLY static members (static fields, static methods, etc.)

#### Normal (non-static class):
```csharp
class ClassName
{
   static fields
   static methods
   static constructors
   static properties
   static events

   instance fields
   instance methods
   instance constructors
   instance properties
   instance events
   destructors
}
```
Normal (non-static class) is to create both instance & static members or only instance members.

## Enumerations
Enumeration is a collection of constants.
Enumeration is used to specify the list of options allowed to be stored in a field/variable.
Use enumeration if you don't want to allow other developers to assign other values into a field/variable, other than the list of values specified in the enumeration.

### Syntax to access member of enum
`EnumerationName.ConstantName`

### Syntax to create Enumeration
```csharp
enum EnumerationName
{
   Constant1, Constant2, …
}
```

By default, each constant will be assigned to a number starting from zero; however, you can change the number (integer only).
```csharp
enum EnumerationName
{
  Constant1 = value, Constant2 = value, …
}
```

The default data type of enum member is "int". However, you can change its data type as follows:
```csharp
enum EnumerationName : datatype
{
   Constant1 = value, Constant2 = value, …
}
```
