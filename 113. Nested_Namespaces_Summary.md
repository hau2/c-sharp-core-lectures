# Nested Namespaces in C#

## Introduction
This lecture is about Nested Namespaces.

Whenever you create a namespace inside another namespace, you can call it as Nested Namespace.

The goal of creating Nested Namespace is creating sub-namespaces; that means subgroups of classes.

## Example
For example, in the HR namespace we have various interfaces and classes such as IEmployee, IManager, IExecutiveManager, AsstManager, etc.

But I would like to group all the interfaces and classes that are related to manager as a subgroup.

So inside the same HR namespace, I would like to create a sub group called Manager, inside which, I would like to add all the interfaces and classes that are related to manager.

### HR Namespace
```csharp
namespace HR
{
    public interface IEmployee { /* ... */ }
    public interface IManager { /* ... */ }
    public interface IExecutiveManager { /* ... */ }
    public class AsstManager { /* ... */ }
}
```

### Manager Namespace
So inside the HR namespace, I am trying to add a child namespace or nested namespace called Manager.

Inside the Manager namespace, I am trying to add the interface called IManager and also the Manager class.

```csharp
namespace HR.Mgr
{
    public interface IManager { /* ... */ }
    public class Manager { /* ... */ }
    public class AsstManager { /* ... */ }
}
```

### Accessing Nested Namespaces
To access the interface or class, you should write the `outernamespace.innernamespace.classname`.

For example, you can access the Manager class as `HR.Mgr.Manager`.

### Benefits of Nested Namespaces
The nested namespace represents a subgroup.

So if you have a large set of classes inside the same namespace; in order to subgroup them; that means a small unit of classes; we can use the nested namespace.

### Example Code
Suppose A is the outer namespace; B is the nested namespace of A; and C is the nested namespace of B.

In that case, the path of 'C' namespace is `A.B.C`.

Like this, if the nested namespaces increase, the steps will increase.

```csharp
namespace A
{
    namespace B
    {
        namespace C
        {
            public class ExampleClass { /* ... */ }
        }
    }
}
```

## Conclusion
The goal of nested namespaces is to create a subgroup inside a big namespace. Inside the outer namespace or inner namespace, you can add various types of types such as classes, interfaces, structures, delegate types, and enumerations.

This is all about nested namespaces in C#.
