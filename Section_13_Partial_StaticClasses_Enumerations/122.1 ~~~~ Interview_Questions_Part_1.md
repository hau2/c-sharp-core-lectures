## Static Classes in C#

### What are static classes in C# and when would you use them?

Static classes in C# are classes that cannot be instantiated and can only contain static members, such as static fields, static properties, and static methods. They are commonly used when you want to provide utility functions or shared resources that can be accessed without creating an instance of the class.

### Explain real world scenarios where static classes are useful

Static classes in C# are useful in various real-world scenarios where you want to provide utility methods, shared functionality, or global access points without needing to instantiate objects of that class. Here are some examples:
- **Utility methods:** Static classes can be used to define utility methods that perform common operations, such as mathematical calculations, string manipulations, or date/time formatting.
- **Helper classes:** Static classes can be used to provide helper methods or functions that assist in performing specific tasks.
- **Global access points:** Static classes can be used as global access points for resources or configurations that need to be shared across different parts of an application.
- **State management:** Static classes can be used to manage shared state or data that needs to be accessed or modified by different parts of an application.
- **Performance optimizations:** Static classes can be used in performance-critical scenarios where the overhead of creating and managing instances of objects is not desirable.
- **Extension methods:** Static classes can be used to define extension methods that provide additional functionality to existing types without modifying their source code.

### What are the restrictions on using static classes in C#?

Static classes in C# have several restrictions:
- Static classes cannot be instantiated, and no instance members can be defined in them.
- Static classes can only contain static members.
- Static members in a static class cannot be overridden or declared as abstract or virtual.
- Static classes cannot be used as a base class or inherited from.
- Static classes are sealed by default, meaning they cannot be inherited.
- Static classes cannot have an instance constructor.

### What is the difference between normal class and static class in C#

In C#, there are several differences between a normal class and a static class:
- **Instantiation:** A normal class can be instantiated, while a static class cannot.
- **Inheritance:** A normal class can be inherited, while a static class cannot.
- **Instance vs. Type members:** A normal class can define both instance and type members, while a static class can only define static members.
- **Initialization:** Normal class objects need to be instantiated, while static members are initialized automatically when the type is accessed for the first time.
- **Memory usage:** Objects of a normal class consume memory for their instance members, while static classes do not consume memory for object instances.
- **Usage:** Normal classes are used for creating multiple instances with their own state, while static classes are used for utility methods, constants, or settings that are shared across all instances of the class.

## Partial Classes in C#

### What are partial classes in C# and when would you use them?

Partial classes in C# allow a class to be split across multiple files, where each part can contain its own members, such as properties, methods, and events. They are combined at compile-time to form a single class. Partial classes are commonly used in scenarios where code generation tools or multiple developers need to work on different parts of a class simultaneously.

### Explain real world scenarios where partial classes are useful

Partial classes in C# are useful in various real-world scenarios:
- **Code generation:** Partial classes are used in scenarios where a portion of the class implementation is generated automatically.
- **Separation of concerns:** Partial classes can be used to separate different concerns or aspects of a class into separate files.
- **Collaboration between developers:** Partial classes can enable multiple developers to work on different parts of a class simultaneously.
- **Readability and maintainability:** Partial classes can improve the readability and maintainability of the codebase by logically grouping related code into separate files.
- **Third-party library customization:** Partial classes can be used to customize the behavior of third-party libraries or frameworks.

### What are partial methods in C# and when would you use them?

Partial methods in C# are used to declare a method in one part of a partial class but allow the implementation of the method to be defined in another part of the same partial class. Partial methods must have a declaration in one part of the partial class and an implementation in another part. If the implementation is not provided, the compiler removes the method during compilation, resulting in no runtime overhead. Partial methods are commonly used in code generation scenarios, where the generated code can provide hooks for developers to implement custom logic.
