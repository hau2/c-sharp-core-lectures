# Lesson Summary: Partial Classes in C#

## Overview
This lesson covers the concept of partial classes in C#. A partial class allows you to split the definition of a class across multiple files, enabling multiple developers to work on different parts of the class simultaneously.

## Key Concepts

### Partial Class
- A partial class is a class that spans across multiple files. Each part of the partial class is defined in separate files.
- When creating an object, all partial class definitions with the same name are combined into a single class.

### Benefits
- Allows multiple developers to work on different parts of the class.
- Facilitates code organization and modularity.
- In Windows Forms and ASP.NET Web Forms, designer-generated code is kept in one partial class, while developer-written code is kept in another.

## Code Examples

### File1.cs
```csharp
namespace Warehouse
{
    public partial class Product
    {
        //private field
        private int _productID;

        //public property
        public int ProductID
        {
            set
            {
                _productID = value;
            }
            get
            {
                return _productID;
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### File2.cs
```csharp
namespace Warehouse
{
    public partial class Product
    {
        //private field
        private double _cost;

        //public property
        public double Cost
        {
            set
            {
                _cost = value;
            }
            get
            {
                return _cost;
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### File3.cs
```csharp
namespace Warehouse
{
    public partial class Product
    {
        //public method
        public double GetTax()
        {
            double tax = Cost * 10 / 100;
            return tax;
        }
    }
}
```

### Program.cs
```csharp
using static System.Console;
using Warehouse;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        //create object of Partial class
        Product product = new Product();

        //access properties
        product.ProductID = 101;
        product.Cost = 1000;

        //access methods
        WriteLine(product.GetTax());

        ReadKey();
    }
}
```

## Conclusion
Partial classes in C# provide a way to split the definition of a class across multiple files. This allows multiple developers to work on different parts of the class simultaneously, making the development process more efficient and organized. Partial classes are especially useful in large projects and in scenarios where designer-generated code needs to be separated from developer-written code.
