# Lesson Summary: Static Classes in C#

## Overview
This lesson covers the concept of static classes in C#. Static classes are used to contain only static members and cannot contain any instance members. They are useful for grouping related static methods and properties together.

## Key Concepts

### Static Class
- A static class can only contain static members.
- It cannot contain any instance members, such as instance fields, instance methods, instance constructors, instance properties, instance events, or destructors.
- The main goal of a static class is to avoid accidental creation of instance members and to prevent the creation of objects for that class.

### Benefits
- Prevents the creation of instance members in the class.
- Ensures that objects of the class cannot be created.
- Static classes are useful for storing common project settings or utility methods that are applicable to the entire project.

## Code Examples

### Class1.cs
```csharp
public static class Country
{
    public static string CountryName = "India";
    public static int NoOfStates = 28;

    public static int GetNoOfUnionTerritories()
    {
        return 8;
    }
}
```

### Program.cs
```csharp
using System;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        //access static fields
        Console.WriteLine(Country.CountryName);
        Console.WriteLine(Country.NoOfStates);
        Console.WriteLine(Country.GetNoOfUnionTerritories());

        Console.ReadKey();
    }
}
```

## Conclusion
Static classes in C# are useful for containing only static members and preventing the creation of instance members or objects. They are ideal for storing common settings or utility methods that are applicable to the entire project. Static classes cannot support inheritance or implement interfaces, ensuring that their members are always static.
