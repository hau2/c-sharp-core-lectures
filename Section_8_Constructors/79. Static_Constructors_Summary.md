# Static Constructors

## Overview
This lecture covers the concept of static constructors in C#, including the following topics:
- Instance constructor vs. static constructor
- Initialization of static fields
- Execution timing of static constructors
- Access modifiers of static constructors
- Practical example of static constructors

## Instance Constructor vs. Static Constructor
- **Instance Constructor**: Created without the 'static' modifier and initializes instance fields.
  - Example: `public className`
  - Executes every time a new object of the class is created.
- **Static Constructor**: Created with the 'static' modifier and initializes static fields.
  - Example: `static className`
  - Executes only once throughout the entire application, either when the first object is created for the class or when the class is accessed for the first time in the Main method.

### Example
```csharp
public class Employee
{
    public int EmpID;
    public string EmpName;
    public string Job;
    public static string CompanyName;

    // Instance constructor
    public Employee(int id, string name, string job)
    {
        EmpID = id;
        EmpName = name;
        Job = job;
    }

    // Static constructor
    static Employee()
    {
        CompanyName = "ABC Industries";
    }
}
```

## Execution Timing of Static Constructors
- The static constructor executes only once for the entire application.
- It executes when the class is accessed for the first time, such as when the first object is created or when the class is referenced in the Main method.

### Example
```csharp
class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        // Accessing the Employee class for the first time
        Employee emp1 = new Employee(101, "John Doe", "Developer");
        Console.WriteLine(Employee.CompanyName);
    }
}
```

## Access Modifiers of Static Constructors
- The static constructor is public by default and cannot have any other access modifiers.
- It cannot have parameters or return any value.

## Practical Example
In this example, the static constructor initializes the static field `CompanyName` to "ABC Industries". This initialization occurs only once, regardless of how many objects of the `Employee` class are created.

### Example
```csharp
public class Employee
{
    public int EmpID;
    public string EmpName;
    public string Job;
    public static string CompanyName;

    // Instance constructor
    public Employee(int id, string name, string job)
    {
        EmpID = id;
        EmpName = name;
        Job = job;
    }

    // Static constructor
    static Employee()
    {
        CompanyName = "ABC Industries";
    }
}

class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        Employee emp1 = new Employee(101, "John Doe", "Developer");
        Employee emp2 = new Employee(102, "Jane Smith", "Manager");
        Employee emp3 = new Employee(103, "Jim Brown", "Analyst");

        Console.WriteLine(Employee.CompanyName);
    }
}
```

## Summary
Static constructors are useful for initializing static fields and performing tasks that need to be executed only once throughout the application. They provide a way to ensure that certain actions are taken the first time a class is accessed.
