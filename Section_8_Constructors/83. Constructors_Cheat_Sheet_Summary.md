# Section Cheat Sheet: Constructors in C#

## Introduction
Constructors are special methods in a class that contain initialization logic for fields. They not only initialize fields but can also contain additional initialization logic.

## Syntax of Constructor
```csharp
public ClassName(Parameter1, Parameter2, ...)
{
    // Initialization logic
}
```

## Rules of Constructors
- The constructor's name should be the same as the class name.
- Constructors are typically public or internal; if private, they can only be called within the same class.
- Constructors can have one or more parameters.
- Constructors do not return any value.
- A class can have multiple constructors, but each must have a different set of parameters.

## Instance vs Static Constructor

### Instance Constructor
```csharp
public ClassName(Parameter1, Parameter2, ...)
{
    // Initialization logic
}
```
- Initializes instance fields.
- Executes automatically each time a new object is created for the class.
- Can use any access modifiers.
- Can contain any initialization logic that should execute every time a new object is created.

### Static Constructor
```csharp
static ClassName()
{
    // Initialization logic
}
```
- Initializes static fields.
- Executes only once, either when the first object is created for the class or when the class is accessed for the first time.
- Access modifier cannot be changed (public by default).
- Can contain initialization logic that should execute only once.

## Parameter-less vs Parameterized Constructor

### Parameter-less Constructor
```csharp
public ClassName()
{
    // Initialization logic
}
```
- Constructor without parameters.
- Generally initializes fields with literal values or contains general initialization logic.

### Parameterized Constructor
```csharp
public ClassName(Parameter1, Parameter2, ...)
{
    // Initialization logic
}
```
- Constructor with one or more parameters.
- Initializes fields by assigning parameter values to fields.

## Implicit vs Explicit Constructor

### Implicit Constructor
```csharp
public ClassName()
{
    // Empty constructor provided by the compiler
}
```
- Automatically provided by the compiler if no constructor is defined.
- Initializes nothing; satisfies the rule that every class must have a constructor.

### Explicit Constructor
```csharp
public ClassName(with or without parameters)
{
    // Initialization logic
}
```
- Created by the developer.
- If defined, the compiler does not provide an implicit constructor.

## Constructor Overloading
- Write multiple constructors with the same name but different sets of parameters (similar to method overloading).
- Recommended to include a parameter-less constructor if using constructor overloading.

### Example of Constructor Overloading
```csharp
public ClassName()
{
    // Initialization logic
}

public ClassName(Parameter1, Parameter2, ...)
{
    // Initialization logic
}
```

## Object Initializer
- Special syntax to initialize fields/properties of a class along with creating the object.
- Executes after the constructor.
- Used to initialize fields/properties after creating the object; cannot contain initialization logic.

### Example of Object Initializer
```csharp
new ClassName() { field1 = value1, field2 = value2, ... }
```
- Use object initializer when there is no constructor or when the constructor is meant for initializing a different set of fields.

## Key Points to Remember
- Instance constructor initializes instance fields but can also access static fields.
- Static constructor initializes static fields but cannot access instance fields.
- The compiler provides a default constructor if the class is defined without any constructor.
- Recommended to write a parameter-less constructor first if creating parameterized constructors.
- Use object initializer to initialize desired fields as soon as a new object is created.
