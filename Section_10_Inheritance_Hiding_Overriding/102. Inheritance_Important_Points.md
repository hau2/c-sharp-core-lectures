# Important Points to Remember about Inheritance

## 1. Parent and Child Classes
- The parent class is a 'base' type of the corresponding child classes.
- Example: In a banking project, the bank account is the 'base class' or 'parent class'; and all types of bank accounts such as 'savings account', 'current account', 'loan account' are the child classes of the BankAccount parent class.

## 2. Using the 'base' Keyword
- By using the 'base' keyword in the child class, you can call the parent class's members; i.e., parent class's fields, parent class's properties, and parent class's methods.

## 3. Object Creation
- When you create an object for the child class, the memory will be allocated for both the parent class's fields and the child class's fields.

## 4. Accessing Parent Class Fields
- Inside the child class's definition, you cannot directly access the parent class's private fields. However, they are stored in the child class's object and accessible in any method of the parent class.

## 5. Method Hiding
- Method hiding is the concept of overwriting the parent class's method by creating another method in the child class with the same name and signature.
- It is preferred when the parent class's method definition does not meet the requirements of the child class.

## 6. Method Overriding
- Method overriding is used when the child class wants to enhance the parent class's method definition.
- In method overriding, both the parent class's method and the child class's method execute.
- Always call the parent class's method using the 'base' keyword as the first statement in the child class's method.

## 7. Types of Inheritance
- C# supports almost all types of inheritance such as hierarchical and hybrid, but it does not support multiple inheritance.
- Multiple inheritance can be achieved in C# by adding multiple parent interfaces.

These are the key points from the section on Inheritance.
