# Summary of Interview Questions

## 1. Explain inheritance in C# and how it works.
Inheritance is a concept in C# that allows a class to inherit properties and behaviors from another class, known as the base or parent class. The class that inherits from the base class is called the derived or child class. Inheritance promotes code reuse, encapsulation, and polymorphism. In C#, inheritance is achieved using the colon (:) symbol, followed by the name of the base class after the class declaration.

Example:
```csharp
class ParentClass
{
    // Parent class implementation
}

class ChildClass : ParentClass
{
    // Child class implementation
}
```

## 2. How do you invoke a parent class constructor from a derived class in C#?
In C#, you can invoke a parent class constructor from a derived class using the `base` keyword. The `base` keyword is used to access members of the base class, including constructors.

Example:
```csharp
public class DerivedClass : ParentClass
{
    public DerivedClass(parameters) : base(baseParameters)
    {
        // Derived class constructor code
    }
}
```

## 3. What are rules of method overriding and in which scenarios to use it?
Method overriding in C# is a feature that allows a derived class to provide a new implementation for a virtual or abstract method that is already defined in its base class.

Key points about method overriding:
- Method overriding is only applicable to virtual or abstract methods in the base class. Virtual methods are marked with the `virtual` keyword, and abstract methods are marked with the `abstract` keyword.
- The signature of the overriding method in the derived class must match the signature of the virtual or abstract method in the base class.
- The `override` keyword is used in the derived class to indicate that a method is intended to override a virtual or abstract method in the base class.

## 4. What are rules of method hiding and in which scenarios to use it?
Method hiding in C# is a feature that allows a derived class to provide a new implementation for a non-virtual, non-abstract method that is already defined in its base class.

Key points about method hiding:
- Method hiding is only applicable to non-virtual, non-abstract methods in the base class.
- The signature of the hiding method in the derived class must match the signature of the hidden method in the base class.
- The `new` keyword is used in the derived class to indicate that a method is intended to hide a method in the base class.

## 5. What is the difference between method overriding and method hiding and when to use which one. Explain with real world scenario.
Method overriding allows a derived class to provide a new implementation for a method that is already defined in the base class.

Example of method overriding:
```csharp
class Animal
{
    public virtual void MakeSound()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Animal makes sound");
    }
}

class Dog : Animal
{
    public override void MakeSound()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Dog barks");
    }
}
```

Method hiding allows a derived class to define a new method with the same name as a method in the base class, but without changing the implementation of the base class method.

Example of method hiding:
```csharp
class Animal
{
    public void MakeSound()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Animal makes sound");
    }
}

class Dog : Animal
{
    public new void MakeSound()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Dog barks");
    }
}
```

## 6. What are sealed classes and sealed methods in C#?
### Sealed class:
A sealed class is a class that cannot be inherited by other classes. Sealed classes are used to prevent further modification or extension of a class, and they are marked with the `sealed` keyword.

Example:
```csharp
sealed class MySealedClass
{
    // Class members and implementation
}
```

### Sealed method:
A sealed method is a method in a class that cannot be overridden by methods in derived classes. Sealed methods are used to prevent further modification or extension of a method's implementation in derived classes, and they are marked with the `sealed` keyword.

Example:
```csharp
using System;

class ParentClass
{
    public virtual void Foo()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("ParentClass Foo");
    }

    public virtual void Bar()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("ParentClass Bar");
    }
}

class ChildClass : ParentClass
{
    public sealed override void Bar()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("ChildClass Bar");
    }
}
```

## 7. Can you explain the use of the 'base' keyword in C# with respect to inheritance?
In C#, the `base` keyword is used to refer to the base class from within a derived class. It is used to call the members of the base class, or to explicitly invoke the constructor of the base class from the constructor of the derived class.

Example:
```csharp
class ParentClass
{
    public void Foo()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("ParentClass Foo");
    }
}

class ChildClass : ParentClass
{
    public new void Foo()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("ChildClass Foo");
    }

    public void Bar()
    {
        base.Foo(); // Calls the Foo method in the ParentClass
    }
}
```

## 8. Difference between ‘base’ keyword and ‘this’ keyword in C#?
In C#, the `base` keyword is used to refer to the base class from within a derived class. The `this` keyword is used to refer to the current instance of the class.

## 9. What is constructor chaining in C#? Explain with an example.
Constructor chaining in C# is the process of calling one constructor from another constructor from a derived class to a base class.

Example:
```csharp
class Animal
{
    protected string species;

    public Animal(string species)
    {
        this.species = species;
    }
}

class Dog : Animal
{
    public Dog(string species, string name) : base(species)
    {
        this.name = name;
    }
}
```

## 10. Can we override a constructor in C#?
Constructors cannot be overridden, as they are not inherited by derived classes and do not participate in polymorphism.

## 11. What is the difference between method overloading and method overriding in C#?
### Method Overloading:
- Allows a class to define multiple methods with the same name but with different parameters.
- Resolved at compile-time.

### Method Overriding:
- Allows a derived class to provide a new implementation for a method that is already defined in its base class.
- Resolved at runtime.
