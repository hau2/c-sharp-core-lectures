# Method Overriding in C#

## Introduction
Method overriding is the process of extending a parent class's method by creating another method with the same signature in the child class. This allows the child class to provide its own implementation while still calling the parent class's method.

## Definition
Method overriding involves:
- Using the `virtual` keyword in the parent class's method.
- Using the `override` keyword in the child class's method.
- Calling the parent class's method using the `base` keyword in the child class's method.

## Example Code

### Parent Class with `virtual` Method
```csharp
public class Employee
{
    public virtual int GetHealthInsuranceAmount()
    {
        return 500;
    }
}
```

### Child Class with `override` Method
```csharp
public class Manager : Employee
{
    public override int GetHealthInsuranceAmount()
    {
        int baseAmount = base.GetHealthInsuranceAmount();
        return baseAmount + 1000;
    }
}
```

### Program Class
```csharp
public class Program
{
    public static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        Manager mgr = new Manager();
        Console.WriteLine(mgr.GetHealthInsuranceAmount()); // Output: 1500
    }
}
```

## Using the `base` Keyword
The `base` keyword is used to call the parent class's method from the child class's method. This ensures that both the parent and child class methods are executed.

### Example Code with `base` Keyword
```csharp
public class Manager : Employee
{
    public override int GetHealthInsuranceAmount()
    {
        int baseAmount = base.GetHealthInsuranceAmount();
        return baseAmount + 1000;
    }
}
```

## Behavior of Method Overriding
- When a method is called on a child class object, both the parent class's method and the child class's method are executed.
- When a method is called on a parent class object, only the parent class's method is executed.
- Method overriding allows the child class to extend the functionality of the parent class's method.

## Conclusion
Method overriding is a powerful feature in C# that allows for extending and customizing the behavior of inherited methods. By using the `virtual` and `override` keywords, developers can create flexible and maintainable code.
