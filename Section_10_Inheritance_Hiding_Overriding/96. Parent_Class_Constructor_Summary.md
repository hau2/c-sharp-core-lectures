# Accessing the Parent Class's Constructor

## Introduction
In C#, a child class can call the constructor of its parent class to initialize the fields of the parent class. This is essential when both the parent and child classes have their own fields that need initialization.

## Calling the Parent Class's Constructor
When an object of the child class is created, the parent class's constructor is not called by default. To call the parent class's constructor, use the `base` keyword within the child class's constructor.

### Example Code

```csharp
public class Employee
{
    public int EmpID { get; set; }
    public string EmpName { get; set; }
    public string Location { get; set; }

    public Employee(int empID, string empName, string location)
    {
        EmpID = empID;
        EmpName = empName;
        Location = location;
    }
}

public class Manager : Employee
{
    public string DepartmentName { get; set; }

    public Manager(int empID, string empName, string location, string departmentName)
        : base(empID, empName, location)
    {
        DepartmentName = departmentName;
    }

    public string GetFullDepartmentName()
    {
        return $"{DepartmentName} at {Location}";
    }
}

public class Program
{
    public static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        Manager mgr = new Manager(1, "John Doe", "New York", "Accounting");
        Console.WriteLine(mgr.GetFullDepartmentName()); // Output: Accounting at New York
    }
}
```

## Parameterless Constructor
If the parent class has a parameterless constructor, it is optional to call it explicitly from the child class. It will be called automatically when creating an object of the child class.

### Example Code

```csharp
public class Employee
{
    public int EmpID { get; set; }
    public string EmpName { get; set; }
    public string Location { get; set; }

    public Employee()
    {
        Location = "Unknown";
    }
}

public class Manager : Employee
{
    public string DepartmentName { get; set; }

    public Manager(string departmentName)
    {
        DepartmentName = departmentName;
    }
}

public class Program
{
    public static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        Manager mgr = new Manager("Accounting");
        Console.WriteLine($"{mgr.DepartmentName} at {mgr.Location}"); // Output: Accounting at Unknown
    }
}
```

## Protected Fields and `base` Keyword
Protected fields in the parent class can be accessed in the child class using the `base` keyword. These fields are not accessible outside the class hierarchy.

### Example Code

```csharp
public class Employee
{
    protected string Location { get; set; }

    public Employee(string location)
    {
        Location = location;
    }
}

public class Manager : Employee
{
    public string DepartmentName { get; set; }

    public Manager(string location, string departmentName)
        : base(location)
    {
        DepartmentName = departmentName;
    }

    public string GetFullDepartmentName()
    {
        return $"{DepartmentName} at {base.Location}";
    }
}

public class Program
{
    public static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        Manager mgr = new Manager("Los Angeles", "Accounting");
        Console.WriteLine(mgr.GetFullDepartmentName()); // Output: Accounting at Los Angeles
    }
}
```

## Conclusion
Using the `base` keyword to call the parent class's constructor ensures that all necessary fields in both the parent and child classes are properly initialized. This practice promotes better code organization and adherence to object-oriented principles.
