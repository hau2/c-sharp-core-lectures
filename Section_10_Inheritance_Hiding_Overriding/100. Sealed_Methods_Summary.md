# Sealed Methods in C#

## Introduction
Sealed methods are used to prevent further overriding of a method in derived classes. This is achieved by using the `sealed` modifier. Sealed methods can only be used in the context of overriding methods.

## Definition
- Sealed methods can only be applied to methods that override a virtual method in a parent class.
- The `sealed` modifier prevents the method from being overridden in any further derived classes.

## Example Code

### Parent Class with `virtual` Method
```csharp
public class Employee
{
    public virtual int GetInsuranceAmount()
    {
        return 500;
    }
}
```

### Child Class with `sealed` Override Method
```csharp
public class Manager : Employee
{
    public sealed override int GetInsuranceAmount()
    {
        return 1000;
    }
}
```

### Attempting to Override a Sealed Method (Compile-Time Error)
```csharp
public class BranchManager : Manager
{
    public override int GetInsuranceAmount()
    {
        // This will cause a compile-time error because GetInsuranceAmount is sealed in Manager.
        return 1500;
    }
}
```

## Behavior of Sealed Methods
- A sealed method cannot be overridden by any classes that inherit from the class containing the sealed method.
- This ensures that the implementation of the method in the sealed method class is final and cannot be changed.

## Use Case
Sealed methods are useful when you want to ensure that your method implementation remains unchanged in any further derived classes. This is particularly useful in scenarios where the method implementation is critical to the class's behavior and should not be altered.

### Example of Using Sealed Methods in Real-World Scenarios
```csharp
public class Program
{
    public static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        Manager mgr = new Manager();
        Console.WriteLine(mgr.GetInsuranceAmount()); // Output: 1000

        // BranchManager bm = new BranchManager();
        // Console.WriteLine(bm.GetInsuranceAmount()); // This will cause a compile-time error.
    }
}
```

## Conclusion
Sealed methods provide a way to enforce method behavior by preventing further overriding in derived classes. They are a powerful tool for maintaining control over method implementations and ensuring consistency in class behavior.
