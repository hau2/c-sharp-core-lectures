# Creating Inheritance

## Understanding Inheritance
Inheritance is a concept where a class (child class) derives from another class (parent class), creating an is-a relationship. This allows the child class to inherit fields, methods, and properties from the parent class.

### Types of Inheritance
- **Single Inheritance**: A child class inherits from one parent class.
- **Multiple Inheritance**: A child class inherits from multiple parent classes (not directly supported in C#).
- **Multi-level Inheritance**: A child class inherits from another child class.
- **Hierarchical Inheritance**: Multiple child classes inherit from one parent class.
- **Hybrid Inheritance**: A combination of two or more types of inheritance.

## Accessing Parent Class Members
Using the `base` keyword, you can access members of the parent class from the child class.

## Invoking Parent Class Constructor
The constructor of a parent class can be invoked using the `base` keyword within the child class constructor.

## Method Hiding and Method Overriding
- **Method Hiding**: A child class defines a method with the same name as a method in the parent class using the `new` keyword.
- **Method Overriding**: A child class provides a specific implementation for a method that is already defined in its parent class using the `override` keyword.

### Example Code

```csharp
using System;

namespace ClassLibrary1
{
    public class Employee
    {
        public int EmpID { get; set; }
        public string EmpName { get; set; }
        public string Location { get; set; }
    }

    public class Manager : Employee
    {
        public string Department { get; set; }

        public int GetTotalSalesOfTheYear()
        {
            return 10000;
        }
    }

    public class SalesMan : Employee
    {
        public string Region { get; set; }

        public int GetSalesOfCurrentMonth()
        {
            return 5000;
        }
    }
}

namespace InheritanceExample
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            Employee emp = new Employee { EmpID = 1, EmpName = "John Doe", Location = "New York" };
            Console.WriteLine($"Employee: {emp.EmpID}, {emp.EmpName}, {emp.Location}");

            Manager mgr = new Manager { EmpID = 2, EmpName = "Jane Smith", Location = "Los Angeles", Department = "Sales" };
            Console.WriteLine($"Manager: {mgr.EmpID}, {mgr.EmpName}, {mgr.Location}, {mgr.Department}, Total Sales: {mgr.GetTotalSalesOfTheYear()}");

            SalesMan sm = new SalesMan { EmpID = 3, EmpName = "Tom Johnson", Location = "Chicago", Region = "North" };
            Console.WriteLine($"SalesMan: {sm.EmpID}, {sm.EmpName}, {sm.Location}, {sm.Region}, Sales of Current Month: {sm.GetSalesOfCurrentMonth()}");
        }
    }
}
```

## Practical Application
In real-world projects, inheritance helps in creating a hierarchy of classes that share common properties and methods. For example:
- **Vehicle** (parent class) with child classes like **Car** and **Bus**.
- **ElectronicDevice** (parent class) with child classes like **MobilePhone** and **Laptop**.

### Conclusion
Inheritance allows for code reusability and the creation of a logical class hierarchy, making it easier to manage and maintain the codebase.
