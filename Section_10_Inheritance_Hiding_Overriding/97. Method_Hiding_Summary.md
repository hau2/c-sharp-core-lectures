# Method Hiding in C#

## Introduction
Method hiding is the process of hiding a parent class method by creating another method with the same signature in the child class. This allows the child class to provide its own implementation of the method.

## Definition
Method hiding involves the child class defining a method with the same name, return type, and parameters as a method in the parent class. This new method in the child class hides the parent class's method.

## Example Code

### Parent Class
```csharp
public class Employee
{
    public virtual int GetHealthInsuranceAmount()
    {
        return 500;
    }
}
```

### Child Class with Method Hiding
```csharp
public class Manager : Employee
{
    public new int GetHealthInsuranceAmount()
    {
        return 1000;
    }
}
```

### Program Class
```csharp
public class Program
{
    public static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        Manager mgr = new Manager();
        Console.WriteLine(mgr.GetHealthInsuranceAmount()); // Output: 1000

        Employee emp = new Employee();
        Console.WriteLine(emp.GetHealthInsuranceAmount()); // Output: 500

        Employee empAsMgr = new Manager();
        Console.WriteLine(empAsMgr.GetHealthInsuranceAmount()); // Output: 500
    }
}
```

## Using the `new` Keyword
When performing method hiding, it is recommended to use the `new` keyword to indicate that the method hiding is intentional. This prevents compiler warnings and makes the code more readable.

### Example Code with `new` Keyword
```csharp
public class Manager : Employee
{
    public new int GetHealthInsuranceAmount()
    {
        return 1000;
    }
}
```

## Behavior of Method Hiding
- When a method is called on a child class object, the child class's method is executed, and the parent class's method is hidden.
- When a method is called on a parent class object, the parent class's method is executed.
- When a method is called on a parent class reference to a child class object, the parent class's method is executed unless the method is overridden.

## Conclusion
Method hiding is useful when the child class needs to provide a different implementation of a method without modifying the parent class. It is essential to use the `new` keyword to indicate intentional hiding and ensure clarity in the code.

## Next Steps
In the next lecture, we will explore method overriding, which provides a more flexible approach to modifying inherited methods.
