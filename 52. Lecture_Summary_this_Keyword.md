# Lecture Summary: 'this' Keyword

## Overview
This lecture explains the 'this' keyword in C#. The 'this' keyword is a predefined keyword that refers to the current object of the particular method.

## Usage
The 'this' keyword is only available for instance methods (non-static methods) and not for static methods. It allows you to refer to the fields and methods of the current object.

### Example:
```csharp
public class Product {
    private int productID;
    
    public void SetProductID(int productID) {
        this.productID = productID; // 'this' refers to the current object
    }
}
```

## Instance Methods
Every instance method must have a current object. When you call an instance method, the 'this' keyword refers to the object used to call the method.

### Example:
```csharp
Product product1 = new Product();
Product product2 = new Product();

product1.SetProductID(1001); // 'this' refers to product1
product2.SetProductID(1002); // 'this' refers to product2
```

## Static Methods
The 'this' keyword is not available in static methods because static methods do not have a current object.

### Example:
```csharp
public static void ExampleStaticMethod() {
    // 'this' keyword is not available here
}
```

## Detailed Explanation
When calling a method with the same name for the parameter and the field, the 'this' keyword is compulsory to distinguish between the parameter and the field.

### Example:
```csharp
public class Product {
    private int productID;
    
    public void SetProductID(int productID) {
        this.productID = productID; // 'this.productID' refers to the field
    }
}
```

## Optional Usage
When the parameter name does not match any field name, the use of the 'this' keyword is optional.

### Example:
```csharp
public class Product {
    private int productID;
    
    public void CalculateTax() {
        double tax = this.productID * 0.1; // 'this' keyword usage is optional
    }
}
```

## Code Examples
Below are some detailed code examples extracted from the provided project files.

### Example from `ClassLibrary1`
```csharp
// Example method from ClassLibrary1
public class ExampleClass {
    private int field;

    public void ExampleMethod(int param) {
        this.field = param; // 'this' refers to the current object
    }
}
```

## Conclusion
The 'this' keyword is a powerful tool in C# for referring to the current object in instance methods. It helps distinguish between fields and parameters with the same name and is crucial for writing clear and correct code.
