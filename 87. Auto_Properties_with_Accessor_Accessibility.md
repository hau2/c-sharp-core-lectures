## Lecture: Auto-Properties with Accessor Accessibility

### Overview
This lecture covers automatic properties, also known as auto-implemented properties, introduced in C# 3.0. These properties simplify the syntax by automatically generating the get and set accessors without the need for explicit field declarations.

### Key Points

1. **Definition**: 
   - Automatic properties contain get and set accessors but do not have explicit definitions for them.
   - The C# compiler generates the definitions during compilation.

2. **Usage**:
   - Ideal when no validation or calculation is needed in the accessors.
   - The compiler creates a private field automatically, prefixed with an underscore.
   
3. **Access Modifiers**:
   - Access modifiers can be specified for get and set accessors individually.
   - The modifiers for the accessors must be more restrictive than the property itself.

4. **Read-only Properties**:
   - Can be created by defining only the get accessor.

### Example Code

#### Automatic Property Example
```csharp
public class Employee
{
    public string NativePlace { get; set; }
}

// Usage in Main Method
class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        Employee emp = new Employee();
        emp.NativePlace = "New Delhi"; // Set accessor
        Console.WriteLine(emp.NativePlace); // Get accessor
    }
}
```

#### Access Modifiers Example
```csharp
public class Employee
{
    public string NativePlace { get; internal set; }
}

// Usage in Main Method
class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        Employee emp = new Employee();
        emp.NativePlace = "New Delhi"; // Allowed
        // Console.WriteLine(emp.NativePlace); // Error: Inaccessible due to internal set accessor
    }
}
```

### Summary
Automatic properties are a shorthand syntax for defining properties without custom logic. They streamline code and are suitable for properties without validation or calculations. Access modifiers can be customized for individual accessors to control their visibility.
