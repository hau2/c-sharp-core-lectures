# Understanding `IDisposable` Interface in C#

## Introduction
The `IDisposable` interface is a predefined interface in the `System` namespace. It contains a single method, `Dispose`, which is used to release unmanaged resources.

## Why Use `IDisposable`
In C#, the `Dispose` method is an alternative to the destructor. The destructor executes automatically and cannot be explicitly called, meaning the developer has no control over when it executes. This can be problematic for long-running applications that need to release resources like database connections or file handles promptly. By using `Dispose`, these resources can be released explicitly, providing better control and efficiency.

## Implementing `IDisposable`
To implement `IDisposable`, a class needs to:
1. Implement the `System.IDisposable` interface.
2. Provide an implementation for the `Dispose` method, where the unmanaged resources are released.

### Example Implementation

```csharp
using System;

namespace ClassLibrary1
{
    public class Sample : System.IDisposable
    {
        // Constructor
        public Sample()
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Database connected.");
        }

        // Method to display data
        public void DisplayDataFromDatabase()
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Reading data from database");
        }

        // Dispose method to release resources
        public void Dispose()
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Database disconnected");
        }
    }
}
```

### Using the `Dispose` Method

The `Dispose` method can be called explicitly or used within a `using` block. The `using` block ensures that `Dispose` is called automatically when the block is exited, even if an exception occurs.

```csharp
using System;
using ClassLibrary1;

namespace IDisposableExample
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main()
        {
            // Create object using "using structure"
            using (Sample s = new Sample())
            {
                s.DisplayDataFromDatabase();
            }

            Console.WriteLine("Some other work here");
            Console.ReadKey();
        }
    }
}
```

In this example:
- The `Sample` class opens a database connection in its constructor and closes it in the `Dispose` method.
- The `Program` class uses the `Sample` class within a `using` block, ensuring the `Dispose` method is called at the end of the block, releasing the database connection promptly.
