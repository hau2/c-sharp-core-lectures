# Understanding `Using Declaration` in C#

## Introduction
The `Using Declaration` is a feature introduced in C# 8.0. It simplifies resource management by providing a shorthand for invoking the `Using Structure`.

## Why Use `Using Declaration`
The `Using Declaration` is a shortcut to ensure that the `Dispose` method is called at the end of a method or block scope, without the need for braces `{}`. This makes the code cleaner and more concise.

### Example Implementation

```csharp
using System;

namespace ClassLibrary1
{
    public class Sample : System.IDisposable
    {
        // Constructor
        public Sample()
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Database connected.");
        }

        // Method to display data
        public void DisplayDataFromDatabase()
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Reading data from database");
        }

        // Dispose method to release resources
        public void Dispose()
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Database disconnected");
        }
    }
}
```

### Using the `Using Declaration`

The `Using Declaration` can be used in place of the `Using Structure` to automatically call the `Dispose` method at the end of a method.

```csharp
using System;
using ClassLibrary1;

namespace IDisposableExample
{
    class Program
    {
        static void DoWork()
        {
            // Create object using "using declaration"
            using Sample s = new Sample();
            s.DisplayDataFromDatabase();
        } // Dispose gets called here

        static void Main()
        {
            DoWork();
            Console.WriteLine("Some other work here");
            Console.ReadKey();
        }
    }
}
```

In this example:
- The `Sample` class opens a database connection in its constructor and closes it in the `Dispose` method.
- The `Program` class uses the `Sample` class within a `using` declaration in the `DoWork` method. The `Dispose` method is called automatically at the end of the `DoWork` method.

## Benefits of `Using Declaration`
- **Cleaner Code**: Reduces the need for extra braces `{}` making the code more readable.
- **Automatic Disposal**: Ensures that the `Dispose` method is called automatically at the end of the method or block scope.
- **Scope Management**: Can be used within any block scope, such as `if` statements, to ensure resources are released promptly.

## Summary
The `Using Declaration` provides a more concise way to manage resources in C#. It is a beneficial feature in C# 8.0 that simplifies the syntax for ensuring resources are properly disposed of, improving code readability and maintainability.
