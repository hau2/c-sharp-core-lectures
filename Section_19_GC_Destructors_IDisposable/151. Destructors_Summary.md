# Destructors in C#

## Overview
A destructor is a special method of a class that is used to close unmanaged resources (such as database connections and file connections) that are opened during the class execution. It ensures that there is no memory wastage or leakage.

## Syntax
```csharp
~ClassName()
{
    //body hereâ€¦
}
```

### Key Points
- Destructor's name should be the same as the class name, prefixed with a `~` (tilde) character.
- A class can have only one destructor.
- Destructors cannot have parameters or return values.
- They are implicitly public and cannot have access modifiers.
- Destructors cannot be overloaded, inherited, or explicitly called.
- Destructors are automatically called by the CLR just before an object is destroyed.

## Usage
Destructors are mainly used for cleaning up unmanaged resources. Managed resources are cleaned up by the garbage collector, but for unmanaged resources, destructors are necessary.

### Example

#### Sample Class
```csharp
using System;

namespace ClassLibrary1
{
    public class Sample
    {
        // Constructor
        public Sample()
        {
            // File & DB connection logic here
            Console.WriteLine("File is opened");
        }

        // Destructor
        ~Sample()
        {
            // File & DB closing logic here
            Console.WriteLine("File is closed");
        }
    }
}
```

#### Program Class
```csharp
using System;
using ClassLibrary1;

namespace DestructorExample
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main()
        {
            // Create object of Sample class
            Sample s = new Sample();

        } // Destructor gets called here automatically
    }
}
```

## Destructor vs Finalize Method
- Internally, destructors are compiled as the `Finalize` method.
- The term "destructor" is used in C# language, whereas "Finalize" belongs to the .NET framework. Both are interchangeable.
- The compiled `Finalize` method calls the `Finalize` method of the corresponding base class.

## Best Practices
- Always close unmanaged resources such as file and database connections in the destructor to avoid memory leaks and performance issues.
- Avoid writing business logic in destructors.

## Rules for Destructors
- Destructors cannot be virtual, abstract, or overridden.
- They can only be defined in classes, not in structs or interfaces.
- Destructors are automatically called by the CLR and cannot be called explicitly in the code.

## Conclusion
Destructors in C# are essential for resource management, especially for unmanaged resources. Proper use of destructors ensures efficient memory management and application performance.
