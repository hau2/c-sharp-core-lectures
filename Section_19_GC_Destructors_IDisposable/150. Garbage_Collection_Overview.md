# Garbage Collection & Generations

## Overview

Garbage Collection is a process of deleting the unwanted objects from the memory after usage.

In C#, objects are created and stored inside a special memory area called Heap. When the application execution starts, a special memory area is reserved for that application, called the heap. All objects created by the developer are stored in the Heap.

Whenever the CLR (Common Language Runtime) needs free space to create new objects, it may perform the Garbage Collection process automatically to free up some objects in order to create new objects. The 'memory manager' component of CLR allocates memory for objects, and the Garbage Collector is responsible for performing the Garbage Collection process.

## Heap and Memory Management

- All objects of all types of classes, including predefined and user-defined classes, are stored in the heap.
- Heap is only one for the entire application lifetime. A new heap is created every time you run the application, and it is deleted automatically at the end of the application.
- The default heap size is approximately 64 MB, depending on the CLR version.
- Garbage Collection occurs automatically when there is no free space to create new objects. Developers can also explicitly call the `GC.Collect` method to invoke Garbage Collection.

## Generations in Garbage Collection

CLR uses the Mark and Compact algorithm to perform Garbage Collection, dividing objects into three generations:

1. **Generation 0 (Short-lived generation)**: The youngest generation containing newly created objects. Objects are first allocated here.
2. **Generation 1 (Middle level generation)**: Acts as a buffer between Generation 0 and Generation 2, containing frequently used and commonly accessed objects.
3. **Generation 2 (Long-lived generation)**: Contains the oldest objects, which are subject to deletion during the next Garbage Collection.

## Managed vs. Unmanaged Resources

- **Managed Resources**: Objects created by CLR that participate in Garbage Collection, part of the .NET Framework.
- **Unmanaged Resources**: Objects not created or managed by CLR, such as file streams and database connections.

## Clearing Unmanaged Resources

- **Destructor**: Clears unmanaged resources just before deleting the object, generally at the end of application execution.
- **Dispose**: Clears unmanaged resources after the specific task is completed, so there is no need to wait until the end of application execution.

## Summary from PDF

Garbage Collection in C# involves automatically freeing memory by deleting unreferenced objects stored in the heap. The process is managed by the CLR's Garbage Collector, which operates on objects divided into three generations for efficient memory management. Developers can use the `GC.Collect` method to trigger Garbage Collection manually when needed.

The generation algorithm (Mark and Compact) ensures that objects are categorized based on their lifespan and usage frequency, optimizing memory usage and application performance. Managed resources are handled by the CLR, while unmanaged resources require explicit handling through destructors or the Dispose pattern.
