# Local Functions in C#

## Introduction
In this lecture, we will introduce local functions, a feature newly introduced in C# 7.0. Local functions are small functions defined within a method to perform small, reusable tasks.

## What are Local Functions?
Local functions are collections of statements to perform small processes as part of a larger method. They help in organizing code and making it more readable and maintainable by breaking down complex methods into smaller, reusable parts.

### Key Points:
- Local functions can have parameters and return types.
- They can only be called within the method where they are defined.
- Local functions cannot have access modifiers or other modifiers like 'virtual' or 'abstract'.
- They help in achieving reusability within the same method.

### Example
Consider a class `Student` with a method `DisplayMarks` that uses a local function to calculate the average marks.

```csharp
public class Student
{
    public void DisplayMarks(int marks1, int marks2, int marks3)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Marks 1: {marks1}");
        Console.WriteLine($"Marks 2: {marks2}");
        Console.WriteLine($"Marks 3: {marks3}");

        double getAverageMarks()
        {
            double avg = (marks1 + marks2 + marks3) / 3.0;
            return avg;
        }

        double average = getAverageMarks();
        Console.WriteLine($"Average Marks: {average}");
    }
}
```

When calling this method:

```csharp
Student s = new Student();
s.DisplayMarks(80, 45, 71);
```

The method `getAverageMarks` is a local function that calculates the average of the three marks.

### Code Illustration
```csharp
using System;

public class Student
{
    public void DisplayMarks(int marks1, int marks2, int marks3)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Marks 1: {marks1}");
        Console.WriteLine($"Marks 2: {marks2}");
        Console.WriteLine($"Marks 3: {marks3}");

        double getAverageMarks()
        {
            double avg = (marks1 + marks2 + marks3) / 3.0;
            return avg;
        }

        double average = getAverageMarks();
        Console.WriteLine($"Average Marks: {average}");
    }
}

public class Program
{
    public static void Main()
    {
        Student s = new Student();
        s.DisplayMarks(80, 45, 71);
    }
}
```

## Conclusion
Local functions in C# 7.0 help in organizing and simplifying code by breaking down complex methods into smaller, reusable parts. They enhance code readability and maintainability by encapsulating small processes within a method.

In the next lecture, we will explore more advanced features of C#.
