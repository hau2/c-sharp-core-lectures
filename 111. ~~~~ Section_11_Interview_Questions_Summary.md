## Abstract Class in C#
An abstract class in C# is a class that cannot be instantiated and can only be used as a base for other classes. It can have both abstract and non-abstract (concrete) methods, and it can also have fields, properties, and events.

### Key Points
- An abstract class can have fields, properties, and events.
- A class can inherit from only one abstract class.
- An abstract class can provide implementation of methods (non-abstract methods).

## Multiple Inheritance Using Interfaces in C#
Multiple inheritance of behavior can be achieved in C# using interfaces. A class can implement multiple interfaces, which allows it to inherit behavior from multiple sources.

### Example
```csharp
interface IMediaFile
{
    string FileName { get; set; }
    void Play();
}

interface IImageFile : IMediaFile
{
    int Width { get; set; }
    int Height { get; set; }
    void Resize(int newWidth, int newHeight);
}

interface IAudioFile : IMediaFile
{
    int BitRate { get; set; }
    void ConvertToMp3();
}

interface IVideoFile : IMediaFile
{
    int FrameRate { get; set; }
    void ExtractAudio();
}

class RecordedFile : IImageFile, IAudioFile, IVideoFile
{
    public string FileName { get; set; }
    public void Play() { Console.WriteLine($"Playing {FileName}..."); }
    public int Width { get; set; }
    public int Height { get; set; }
    public void Resize(int newWidth, int newHeight) { Console.WriteLine($"Resizing {FileName} to {newWidth}x{newHeight}..."); }
    public int BitRate { get; set; }
    public void ConvertToMp3() { Console.WriteLine($"Converting {FileName} to MP3..."); }
    public int FrameRate { get; set; }
    public void ExtractAudio() { Console.WriteLine($"Extracting audio from {FileName}..."); }
}
```

## Benefits and Limitations of Multiple Inheritance Using Interfaces
### Benefits
- **Reusability:** Promotes code reuse and extensibility.
- **Flexibility:** Allows a class to inherit behavior from unrelated classes.
- **Polymorphism:** Enables polymorphism by providing a common contract for behavior.

### Limitations
- **Ambiguity:** Can lead to ambiguity if interfaces define members with the same name.
- **Complexity:** Managing interactions between multiple interfaces can be complex.
- **Limited Code Reuse:** Each class must provide its own implementation of the interface members.

## Polymorphism Using Interfaces
Polymorphism allows objects of different types to be treated as objects of a common type. In C#, polymorphism can be achieved using interfaces.

### Example
```csharp
interface IGraphicObject
{
    void Render();
    void Move(int x, int y);
    void Resize(double scale);
}

class Circle : IGraphicObject
{
    public void Render() { /* Render circle */ }
    public void Move(int x, int y) { /* Move circle */ }
    public void Resize(double scale) { /* Resize circle */ }
}

class Square : IGraphicObject
{
    public void Render() { /* Render square */ }
    public void Move(int x, int y) { /* Move square */ }
    public void Resize(double scale) { /* Resize square */ }
}
```

## Abstract Class vs. Interface
### Differences
- An abstract class can have implementation code, an interface cannot.
- A class can inherit from only one abstract class but can implement multiple interfaces.
- Abstract class can have fields, properties, and events; an interface can only have method signatures, properties, and events.

## Interface Inheritance
Interface inheritance allows an interface to inherit from one or more interfaces, creating a hierarchy of interfaces.

### Example
```csharp
interface IAnimal
{
    void Eat();
}

interface IDog : IAnimal
{
    void Bark();
}

interface ICat : IAnimal
{
    void Meow();
}
```

## Explicit Interface Implementation
Explicit interface implementation allows a class to provide different implementations for the same member based on the interface being accessed.

### Example
```csharp
interface IShape
{
    void Draw();
}

interface IColorable
{
    void Draw();
}

class Circle : IShape, IColorable
{
    void IShape.Draw() { /* Implementation for IShape */ }
    void IColorable.Draw() { /* Implementation for IColorable */ }
}
```

## Virtual Method vs. Abstract Method
### Virtual Methods
- Provide a default implementation that can be overridden in derived classes.
- Can be called directly from the base class or overridden in derived classes.

### Abstract Methods
- Do not have an implementation in the base class.
- Must be overridden in derived classes.

## Abstraction
Abstraction is a concept that allows you to represent complex systems by simplifying their structure and behavior.

### Benefits
- **Modularity:** Promotes breaking down a system into smaller components.
- **Code Reusability:** Encourages code reuse.
- **Polymorphism:** Enables polymorphism, allowing objects to be treated as instances of a common base type.
- **Design Flexibility:** Provides flexibility in designing systems at a higher level of abstraction.

## Abstraction vs. Encapsulation
### Abstraction
- Focuses on hiding unnecessary details and providing a higher-level view.
- Achieved through abstract classes and interfaces.

### Encapsulation
- Bundles data and methods into a single unit (class).
- Controls access to the internal state of an object.
- Achieved through access modifiers.
