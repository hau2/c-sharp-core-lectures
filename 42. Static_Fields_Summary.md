# Static Fields in C#

In this lecture, we explore static fields.

## Understanding Static Fields

Static fields are declared inside a class using the `static` keyword. They are not stored inside the object but in the class memory. Static fields are common to all objects of a class.

### Example: Bank Account

Consider a class `BankAccount`. Every bank account has:
- Account number
- Account holder name
- Current balance

These details are individual for every bank account.

However, some data is common to all bank accounts, such as the bank name. This should be a static field.

## Comparison: Instance Fields vs. Static Fields

- **Instance Fields**: Stored inside objects, accessible only through object instances.
- **Static Fields**: Stored in class memory, accessible through the class name.

## Example Code

### Bank Account Example

```csharp
public class BankAccount
{
    public int accountNumber;
    public string accountHolderName;
    public double currentBalance;
    public static string bankName = "Bank of Example";

    public BankAccount(int number, string name, double balance)
    {
        accountNumber = number;
        accountHolderName = name;
        currentBalance = balance;
    }
}
```

### Accessing Static Fields

```csharp
public class Program
{
    public static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        BankAccount account1 = new BankAccount(123, "Alice", 5000.0);
        BankAccount account2 = new BankAccount(456, "Bob", 3000.0);

        // Accessing static field using class name
        Console.WriteLine(BankAccount.bankName);
        
        // Instance fields are accessed through objects
        Console.WriteLine(account1.accountHolderName);
        Console.WriteLine(account2.accountHolderName);
    }
}
```

### Product Example with Static Field

```csharp
public class Product
{
    public int productID;
    public string productName;
    public double cost;
    public static int TotalNoOfProducts;

    public Product(int id, string name, double price)
    {
        productID = id;
        productName = name;
        cost = price;
        TotalNoOfProducts++;
    }
}

public class Program
{
    public static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        Product product1 = new Product(1, "Product1", 100.0);
        Product product2 = new Product(2, "Product2", 200.0);
        Product product3 = new Product(3, "Product3", 300.0);

        // Accessing static field using class name
        Console.WriteLine("Total Number of Products: " + Product.TotalNoOfProducts);
    }
}
```

### Key Points

- Static fields are initialized when the class is first accessed.
- They are common to all instances of the class.
- Access static fields using `ClassName.FieldName`.
- Instance fields require object instances for access.

Static fields are useful for data that should be shared among all instances of a class. They help in saving memory and maintaining consistency.

## Summary

- **Static fields**: Common to all objects, stored in class memory.
- **Instance fields**: Unique to each object, stored inside objects.
- Access static fields using the class name.

Static fields provide a way to have shared data among all instances of a class, ensuring efficient memory usage and consistency.
