# Abstraction in Object-Oriented Programming

## 1. What is Abstraction?
- Abstraction is a concept in object-oriented programming where complex systems are represented by simplifying their structure and behavior.
- It involves creating a blueprint or a contract that contains only the important details, such as essential properties or methods of a class.

## 2. Implementation of Abstraction
- Abstraction can be implemented using abstract classes or interfaces.
- The abstract class or interface acts as a parent for child classes and contains only the important and public methods of the particular class.
- These members or methods must be implemented by every child class.

## 3. Example
- Consider the example of a car class. What properties or methods must be contained by every car class? 
- Common features, data values, and operations that must be present in every car class are represented as a contract, either as an abstract class or an interface.

## 4. Difference Between Abstract Class and Interface
- An abstract class or interface acts as a blueprint for the classes.
- Members such as fields, properties, or methods that must be present in every child class should be defined inside the corresponding abstract class or interface.

## 5. Summary
- Abstraction can be remembered as a simplified way of representing a class by creating a blueprint or contract that contains only the public methods that must be present in the class.
- It is analogous to an index for a book, where the index represents the list of chapters without delving into the actual details of the chapters.

These are the key points about abstraction in object-oriented programming.
