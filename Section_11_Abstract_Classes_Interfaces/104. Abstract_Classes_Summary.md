# Abstract Classes in C#

## 1. Introduction
This section is all about abstract classes and interfaces. In this lecture, we will see what abstract classes are and the rules of abstract classes.

## 2. What is an Abstract Class?
An abstract class is a parent class for which we cannot create an object. When it is not meaningful to create an object for the parent class, you can make the parent class an abstract class by adding the 'abstract' keyword to the parent class's definition.

## 3. Real-World Examples
### Vehicle Example
- Vehicle class (abstract)
  - Car class
  - Bus class

### Shape Example
- Shape class (abstract)
  - Circle class
  - Rectangle class

In these examples, the abstract class cannot exist without its child classes.

## 4. Purpose of Abstract Classes
The main intention of the abstract class is to provide a common set of fields, properties, and methods to all its corresponding child classes. Abstract classes can contain all types of members such as fields, properties, methods, constructors, and destructors.

## 5. Rules of Abstract Classes
- Abstract classes cannot be instantiated.
- Creating the child class is the only way to use the abstract class.
- Abstract classes can contain all types of members including abstract methods.
- Abstract methods in an abstract class must be implemented by the child classes.

## 6. Comparison with Normal Classes
### Normal Class
- Can be inherited from other classes and interfaces.
- Can be instantiated.
- Can define non-static and static members.

### Abstract Class
- Can be inherited from other classes and interfaces.
- Cannot be instantiated.
- Can define all types of members including abstract methods.

## 7. Code Example
Below is an example of using abstract classes in a C# application.

```csharp
ï»¿class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        //create object of Manager
        Manager mgr1 = new Manager(102, "Allen", "New York", "Accounting");
        System.Console.WriteLine("Object of Child class (Manager):");
        System.Console.WriteLine(mgr1.EmpID);
        System.Console.WriteLine(mgr1.EmpName);
        System.Console.WriteLine(mgr1.Location);
        System.Console.WriteLine(mgr1.DepartmentName);
        System.Console.WriteLine(mgr1.GetTotalSalesOfTheYear());
        System.Console.WriteLine(mgr1.GetFullDepartmentName());
        System.Console.WriteLine(mgr1.GetHealthInsuranceAmount()); //Manager.GetHealthInsuranceAmount
        System.Console.WriteLine();

        //create object of SalesMan
        SalesMan salesMan1 = new SalesMan(103, "John", "Washington", "East");
        System.Console.WriteLine("Object of Child class (SalesMan):");
        System.Console.WriteLine(salesMan1.EmpID);
        System.Console.WriteLine(salesMan1.EmpName);
        System.Console.WriteLine(salesMan1.Location);
        System.Console.WriteLine(salesMan1.Region);
        System.Console.WriteLine(salesMan1.GetSalesOfTheCurrentMonth());
        System.Console.WriteLine(salesMan1.GetHealthInsuranceAmount()); //Employee.GetHealthInsuranceAmount
        System.Console.WriteLine();

        System.Console.ReadKey();
    }
}


```

## 8. Summary
- Abstract classes are used to provide a common set of members to child classes without instantiating the parent class.
- Use abstract classes when the parent class should not exist without its child classes.

This is all about abstract classes in C#. In the next lecture, we will understand abstract methods.
