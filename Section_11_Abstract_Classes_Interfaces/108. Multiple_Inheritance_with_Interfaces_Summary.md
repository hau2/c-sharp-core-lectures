# Multiple Inheritance with Interfaces in C#

## 1. Introduction
This lecture is about 'Multiple Inheritance'.

## 2. What is Multiple Inheritance?
- Multiple inheritance occurs when a class inherits from more than one parent class or interface.
- C# does not support multiple inheritance with classes, but it does support multiple inheritance with interfaces.

## 3. Example of Multiple Inheritance
### Interfaces
- **IVehicle**: Represents a vehicle with wheels and an engine.
- **IFlyingMachine**: Represents a machine that can fly.

### Class
- **FlyingVehicle**: Inherits from both IVehicle and IFlyingMachine, representing a vehicle that can also fly.

## 4. Syntax of Multiple Inheritance
- A class can implement multiple interfaces by separating them with a comma (`,`).
- Example:
```csharp
public class FlyingVehicle : IVehicle, IFlyingMachine
{
    // Implement methods of both interfaces
}
```

## 5. Rules of Multiple Inheritance
- A class must implement all methods of all the interfaces it inherits from.
- Interface methods are implicitly `public` and `abstract`.

## 6. Code Example
Below is an example of using multiple inheritance with interfaces in a C# application.

```csharp
ï»¿class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        //create reference of parent interface (IEmployee)
        IEmployee emp;

        //create object of Manager
        emp = new Manager(102, "Allen", "New York", "Accounting");
        System.Console.WriteLine(emp.GetHealthInsuranceAmount()); //Manager.GetHealthInsuranceAmount
        System.Console.WriteLine();

        //create object of SalesMan
        emp = new SalesMan(103, "John", "Washington", "East");
        System.Console.WriteLine(emp.GetHealthInsuranceAmount()); //SalesMan.GetHealthInsuranceAmount
        System.Console.WriteLine();

        System.Console.ReadKey();
    }
}


```

## 7. Steps to Implement Multiple Inheritance with Interfaces
1. Define multiple interfaces with their respective methods.
2. Implement the interfaces in a child class.
3. Ensure the child class provides implementations for all interface methods.
4. Create reference variables for the interfaces and assign objects of the child class.

## 8. Summary
- Multiple inheritance allows a class to inherit from multiple interfaces.
- It provides flexibility in design, allowing a class to act as multiple types.
- C# enforces that all interface methods must be implemented by the inheriting class.

This is an overview of multiple inheritance with interfaces in C#. In further lectures, we will cover more advanced topics related to interfaces and inheritance.
