# Dynamic Polymorphism with Interfaces in C#

## 1. Introduction
This lecture covers the concept of polymorphism and the implementation of dynamic polymorphism using interfaces.

## 2. What is Polymorphism?
- Polymorphism is one of the features of object-oriented programming.
- It allows a statement to call different methods in different situations based on object references or arguments supplied.
- Polymorphism means "many forms" and enables decision-making capabilities.

## 3. Types of Polymorphism
### Compile-Time Polymorphism (Static Polymorphism)
- The decision of which method to call is made at compile-time.
- Example: Method Overloading.

### Runtime Polymorphism (Dynamic Polymorphism)
- The decision of which method to call is made at runtime based on the object reference.
- Example: Method Overriding with abstract classes or interfaces.

## 4. Implementation of Dynamic Polymorphism with Abstract Classes
- Abstract classes can have abstract methods that must be implemented by child classes.
- A reference variable of the abstract class can store the reference of any child class object.
- The method called is determined at runtime based on the object referenced.

## 5. Implementation of Dynamic Polymorphism with Interfaces
- Interfaces contain only abstract methods.
- Child classes must implement all methods defined in the interface.
- A reference variable of the interface can store the reference of any child class object.
- The method called is determined at runtime based on the object referenced.

## 6. Code Example
Below is an example of using dynamic polymorphism with interfaces in a C# application.

```csharp
ï»¿class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        //create reference of parent interface (IEmployee)
        IEmployee emp;

        //create object of Manager
        emp = new Manager(102, "Allen", "New York", "Accounting");
        System.Console.WriteLine(emp.GetHealthInsuranceAmount()); //Manager.GetHealthInsuranceAmount
        System.Console.WriteLine();

        //create object of SalesMan
        emp = new SalesMan(103, "John", "Washington", "East");
        System.Console.WriteLine(emp.GetHealthInsuranceAmount()); //SalesMan.GetHealthInsuranceAmount
        System.Console.WriteLine();

        System.Console.ReadKey();
    }
}


```

## 7. Steps to Implement Dynamic Polymorphism with Interfaces
1. Create an interface with abstract methods.
2. Implement the interface methods in multiple child classes.
3. Create a reference variable for the interface.
4. Assign the reference of a child class object to the interface reference variable.
5. Call the interface methods through the reference variable.

## 8. Summary
- Dynamic polymorphism allows methods to be called based on the object referenced at runtime.
- It provides flexibility and reusability in code, enabling different implementations to be used interchangeably.
- Interfaces enforce a contract that child classes must adhere to, ensuring consistency in method implementation.

This is an overview of dynamic polymorphism with interfaces in C#. In further lectures, we will cover more advanced topics related to polymorphism and interfaces.
