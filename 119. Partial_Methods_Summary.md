# Lesson Summary: Partial Methods in C#

## Overview
This lesson covers the concept of partial methods in C#. Partial methods allow a method to be declared in one part of a partial class and implemented in another part of the same partial class. This enables multiple developers to collaborate on different parts of the same class.

## Key Concepts

### Partial Methods
- Partial methods are declared in one partial class but implemented in another partial class with the same name.
- By default, partial methods are private and must be void.

### Benefits
- Enables one developer to declare a method and another developer to implement it.
- Provides flexibility in large projects where different parts of a class are developed by different developers.

## Code Examples

### File1.cs
```csharp
namespace Warehouse
{
    public partial class Product
    {
        //private field
        private int _productID;

        //public property
        public int ProductID
        {
            set
            {
                _productID = value;
            }
            get
            {
                return _productID;
            }
        }

        //declaration of partial method
        partial void GetTax();
    }
}
```

### File2.cs
```csharp
namespace Warehouse
{
    public partial class Product
    {
        //private field
        private double _cost;

        //public property
        public double Cost
        {
            set
            {
                _cost = value;
            }
            get
            {
                return _cost;
            }
        }

        //public method to call partial method
        public void CallGetTax()
        {
            GetTax();
        }

    }
}
```

### File3.cs
```csharp
namespace Warehouse
{
    public partial class Product
    {
        //implementation of partial method
        partial void GetTax()
        {
            double tax = Cost * 10 / 100;
            System.Console.WriteLine(tax);
        }
    }
}
```

### Program.cs
```csharp
using static System.Console;
using Warehouse;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        //create object of Partial class
        Product product = new Product();

        //access properties
        product.ProductID = 101;
        product.Cost = 1000;

        //access methods
        product.CallGetTax();

        ReadKey();
    }
}
```

## Conclusion
Partial methods in C# allow for a method to be declared in one part of a partial class and implemented in another part. This enables multiple developers to collaborate on different parts of the same class. Partial methods are private by default and must be void, providing a structured way for developers to share and implement functionality within a single class.
