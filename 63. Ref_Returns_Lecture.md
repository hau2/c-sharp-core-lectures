# Ref Returns in C#

## Introduction
In this lecture, we will introduce the 'ref returns' feature in C# 7.3. 'Ref returns' allows a method to return a variable by reference, meaning any changes made to the returned variable will affect the original variable.

## What are Ref Returns?
'Ref returns' is the ability of a method to return a variable as a reference. This means the reference of the returned variable is assigned to the calling portion, and any changes made to the returned variable will be automatically reflected in the original variable.

### Key Points:
- The method must return a reference using the 'ref' keyword.
- The calling method must receive the reference using the 'ref' keyword.
- Changes made to the returned reference will affect the original variable.

### Example
Consider a class `Student` with a field `grade` and a method `DoWork` that returns a reference to `grade`.

```csharp
public class Student
{
    public int grade = 2;

    public ref int DoWork()
    {
        return ref grade;
    }
}
```

When calling this method:

```csharp
Student s = new Student();
ref int g = ref s.DoWork();
g = 5;
Console.WriteLine(s.grade); // Output: 5
```

The `DoWork` method returns a reference to `grade`, and changes made to `g` are reflected in `grade`.

### Code Illustration
```csharp
using System;

public class Student
{
    public int grade = 2;

    public ref int DoWork()
    {
        return ref grade;
    }

    public void PrintGrade()
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Grade: {grade}");
    }
}

public class Program
{
    public static void Main()
    {
        Student s = new Student();
        s.PrintGrade(); // Output: Grade: 2

        ref int g = ref s.DoWork();
        g = 5;

        s.PrintGrade(); // Output: Grade: 5
    }
}
```

## Conclusion
The 'ref returns' feature in C# 7.3 is useful when you need to return a reference to a variable rather than its value. This feature allows for more flexible and efficient code, as changes made to the returned reference are automatically reflected in the original variable.

In the next lecture, we will explore more advanced features of C#.
