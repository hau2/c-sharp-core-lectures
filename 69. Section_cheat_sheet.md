## Methods
A method is a function (a group of statements) that performs a process based on fields. Methods are part of a class and can receive one or more input values as "parameters" and return a value as "return".

**Example:**

```java
class Car {
  int calculateEmi(int carPrice, int noOfMonths, int interestRate) {
    // do calculation here
    return emi;
  }
}
```

### Syntax of Method

## Access Modifiers of Methods
Access Modifiers (also known as "Access Specifiers" or "Visibility Modifiers") of methods are the same as access modifiers of fields.

## Encapsulation
Encapsulation is a concept of:
- Bundling the data (fields) and operations (methods) that manipulate the data together.
- Hiding internal implementation details of an object and providing essential members to interact with them.

**Benefits:**
- Modularity
- Hiding implementation details
- Data Integrity

**Implemented using:**
- Private fields
- Public properties or public methods

## Local Variables and Parameters

### Parameters:
- The variables that are received from the "method caller" are called "parameters".
- The parameters are stored in the stack of the method.
- For every method call, a new stack will be created.

### Local Variables:
- The variables declared inside the method are called "Local variables". Local variables can only be used within the same method.
- Local variables are stored in the same stack as parameters.
- The stack will be deleted at the end of the method execution. So, all local variables and parameters will be deleted.

## "this" Keyword
The "this" keyword refers to the "current object" which invoked the method. It is available only within the "instance methods".

## Instance Methods vs Static Methods

### Association:
- **Instance Methods:** Associated with Objects
- **Static Methods:** Associated with class.

### Manipulates:
- **Instance Methods:** Manipulates instance fields.
- **Static Methods:** Manipulates static fields.

### Declaration:
- **Instance Methods:** Declared without "static" keyword. Syntax: `returnType methodName() { }`
- **Static Methods:** Declared with "static" keyword. Syntax: `static returnType methodName() { }`

### Accessible with:
- **Instance Methods:** Accessible with object (through reference variable).
- **Static Methods:** Accessible with class name only (not with object).

### Can access (fields):
- **Instance Methods:** Can access both instance fields and static fields
- **Static Methods:** Can't access instance fields; but can access static fields only.

### Can access (methods):
- **Instance Methods:** Can access both instance methods and static methods.
- **Static Methods:** Can't access instance methods; but can access static methods only.

### "this" keyword:
- **Instance Methods:** Can use "this" keyword as there must be "current object" to call instance method.
- **Static Methods:** Can't use "this" keyword as there is NO "current object" while calling instance methods.

## Reference Variables as Arguments
If you pass "reference variable" as an argument, the reference (address) of the object will be passed to the method. The parameter's data type will be the class name. Any changes to the object in the method will be reflected in the caller method as you are accessing the same object.

## Default Arguments
Default value of the parameter of a method. If you donâ€™t pass value to the parameter, the default value gets assigned to the parameter.

```java
accessModifier modifier returnType MethodName(parameter1) {
  // Method body here
}
```

## Named Arguments
Supply value to the parameter based on parameter name. Syntax: `parametername: value`. You can change the order of parameters while passing arguments. Parameter names are expressive (understandable) at method-calling time. 

**Calling a method:** `MethodName(ParameterName: value, ParameterName: value);`

## Method Overloading
Writing multiple methods with the same name in the same class with different parameters. Caller would have several options while calling a method. Difference between parameters of all the methods that have the same name is a MUST.

```java
MethodName()
MethodName(int)
MethodName(string)
MethodName(int, string)
MethodName(string, int)
MethodName(string, string, int)
```

## Parameter Modifiers
Specifies how the parameter receives a value.
- **Default** (No keyword)
- **ref**
- **out**
- **in**
- **params**

### Parameter Modifiers (default)
The "Argument" will be assigned into the "Parameter" but not the reverse.

### Parameter Modifiers (ref)
The "Argument" will be assigned into the "Parameter" and vice versa. The Argument must be a variable and must be pre-initialized.

### Parameter Modifiers (out)
The "Argument" will not be assigned into the "Parameter" but only in reverse. The Argument must be a variable; The Argument can be un-initialized.

### 'out' variable declaration
You can declare an out variable directly while calling the method with the 'out' parameter. New feature in C# 7.0.

### Parameter Modifiers (in)
The "Argument" will be assigned into the "Parameter" but the parameter becomes read-only. We can't modify the value of the parameter in the method; if you try to change it, a compile-time error will be shown. New feature of C# 7.2.

### ref returns
The reference of the return variable will be assigned to the receiving variable. New feature in C# 7.3.

### Parameter Modifiers (params)
All the set of arguments will be at-a-time received as an array into the parameter. The "params" parameter modifier can be used only for the last parameter of the method; and can be used only once for one method.

## Local Functions
"Local functions" are functions to do some small process which is written inside a method. Local functions are not part of the class; they can't be called directly through a reference variable. Local functions don't support "access modifiers" and "modifiers". Local functions support parameters and return.

## Static Local Functions
"Static Local functions" are functions the same as normal "Local Functions". The only difference is static local functions can't access local variables or parameters of the containing method. This is to avoid accidental access of local variables or parameters of the containing method inside the local function.

## Recursion
A method calls itself. Useful in mathematical computations such as finding the factorial of a number.

## Key Points to Remember
- Method is a part of a class that contains a collection of statements to do some process.
- Access modifiers of Methods: private, protected, private protected, internal, protected internal, public.
- Modifiers of Methods: static, virtual, abstract, override, new, partial, sealed
- For each method call, a new stack will be created; all local variables and parameters of the method will be stored in that stack; will be deleted automatically at the end of method execution.
- In instance methods, the 'this' keyword refers to the 'current object based on which the method is called'.
- Instance methods can access & manipulate instance fields & static fields; Static methods can access only static fields.
- But a static method can create an object for the class; then access instance fields through that object.
- Using named arguments, you can change the order of parameters while calling the method.
- Method Overloading is 'writing multiple methods with the same name in the same class with different sets of parameters'.
- The 'ref' parameter is used to receive value into the method and also return some value back to the method caller; The 'out' parameter is only used to return value back to the method caller; but not for receiving value into the method.
