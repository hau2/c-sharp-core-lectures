# Important Points to Remember about Fields in C#

This lecture summarizes the key points to remember about fields in C#.

## Key Points

### Fields

- Fields are variables created inside a class.
- **Instance fields** are stored in the object.
- **Static fields** are stored outside the object, in the class memory in the heap.

### Access Modifiers

There are six access modifiers for fields:
1. **private**
2. **protected**
3. **private protected**
4. **internal**
5. **protected internal**
6. **public**

### Field Modifiers

There are three field modifiers:
1. **static**
2. **const**
3. **readonly**

### Instance Fields

- Instance fields are unique to each object.
- Values of instance fields differ for every object.

### Static Fields

- Static fields are common to all objects.
- Memory for static fields is allocated once for all objects.
- Static fields' memory is allocated when the class name is accessed for the first time, even if no objects exist.

### Constants

- Constants must be initialized at the time of declaration.
- Constants behave like static fields with a fixed value.
- The value of a constant is common to all objects.

### Readonly Fields

- Readonly fields must be initialized either at the time of declaration or in the instance constructor.
- Readonly fields are by default instance fields.
- The value of a readonly field differs for every object.

## Summary

- Fields can be instance fields or static fields, with instance fields being unique to each object and static fields being shared among all objects.
- Constants and readonly fields provide ways to define immutable values, with constants having a fixed value common to all objects and readonly fields allowing unique values for each object.
- Understanding the access modifiers and field modifiers helps in designing the structure and behavior of fields in a class.

These points provide a comprehensive overview of the different types of fields and their characteristics in C#.
