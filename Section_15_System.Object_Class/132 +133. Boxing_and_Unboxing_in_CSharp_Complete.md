## Overview
This section covers the concepts of Boxing and Unboxing in C#.

### Boxing
Boxing is the process of converting a value type to a reference type. This occurs when a value of a value-type data type is converted to a reference type data type.

#### Example of Boxing
For example, consider an `int` value being converted to a `System.Object` type. Since `int` is a structure (value-type) and `System.Object` is a class (reference type), this conversion is known as Boxing.

#### Automatic Boxing in C#
Boxing in C# happens automatically. You can assign a value from an `int` type directly to a `System.Object` type without needing explicit syntax.

```csharp
int x = 10;
object obj = x;  // Boxing
```
In memory, the value is copied into an object of `System.Object` type, and the address of the object is stored in a reference variable. This shifts the value from the stack to the heap.

### Unboxing
Unboxing is the process of converting a reference type back to a value type. This occurs when a value stored in a reference type is converted back to a value type.

#### Example of Unboxing
Unboxing requires explicit casting. You need to specify the value type you are converting to in parentheses.

```csharp
object obj = 10;  // Boxing
int x = (int)obj;  // Unboxing
```
In memory, unboxing copies the value from the heap back to the stack. This ensures that the value is retrieved from the `System.Object` type back to its original value type.

## Summary
Boxing is a common process in C# where a value of a primitive type is assigned to an object of `System.Object` class, happening internally without explicit syntax. Unboxing, on the other hand, requires explicit casting to convert a reference type back to a value type.
