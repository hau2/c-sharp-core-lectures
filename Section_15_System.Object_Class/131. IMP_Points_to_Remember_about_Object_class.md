# Important Points to Remember about System.Object Class

## Summary
The `System.Object` class in C# is the ultimate base class for all classes, structures, interfaces, and enumerations. This inheritance is implicit, meaning you do not need to explicitly declare inheritance from the `System.Object` class.

## Key Methods
The `System.Object` class contains several methods that are commonly available to all its children, including:
- `ToString`
- `GetHashCode`
- `Equals`

### Method Access
Children (derived classes) can access all methods and properties of their respective parent classes. They can also override methods of the `System.Object` class, such as `Equals`, `GetHashCode`, and `ToString`.

## Purpose
The main purpose of the `System.Object` class is to achieve type safety in C#. This ensures that variables or properties of a specific type cannot be assigned values of a different type, thereby maintaining strict data types.

## Conclusion
The `System.Object` class is fundamental for maintaining type safety and providing common methods to all derived types in C#.
